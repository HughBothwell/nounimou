The Dumpsterfire Returns - FTFE vs Try Thinking

00:01:08  and doing fantastic All Things Considered I do apologize to the audience for the quality of my audio I am currently in do to work so I
00:01:19  literally not an have you meet it add me muted alright hello everybody and welcome to tonight's show oh we're gonna have a
00:01:35  good one I already gave this really wild as introduction we were talking about strippers and clothes coming off dollar bills being thrown everywhere at
00:01:44  everyone and the whole time I was muted and I'm so sorry about that so what we're gonna do is we're gonna restart real quick with the introduction first
00:01:53  off I'm not going to go into the jokes about the corona virus I'm just going to tell you don't shake hands or fist bump or anything like that stay
00:01:59  safe out there we have a dumpster fire tonight FTF e versus try thinkin on a debate over the shape of the earth
00:02:06  now I already said all this in the interest of the guys are probably getting pretty pretty frustrated with having to hear me talk so let me
00:02:15  turn it over to the moderator Jared eighty-two productions how are you doing tonight sir well second time's a charm on this one a there RT yes you're right
00:02:27  I do apologize for audio quality too early I am on a trip due to work and don't have my full set up that is back at the house but an opportunity came up
00:02:42  for some would say intellectual torture and torment and well a bit of shopping for it can be a good thing every now and then so I am going to put mice in the
00:02:54  position between try thinking and ft Fe and try to keep both of them on point and on topic right if you hear my voice again it's because someone is deviating
00:03:08  or they have approached in and reached a time limit on their 10 minute presentations and then rebuttals as we are anxiously awaiting positive evidence
00:03:20  that each person has for the shape of the earth correct correct now turning it over to our first debater ft FV everybody knows
00:03:30  you but why don't you tell everybody a little bit about yourself because I'm sure there's one person out there who
00:03:35  never heard of ft Fe yeah I am ft Fe from the channel that throw stupidity down the stairs of knowledge last night I had a massive dumpster fire we have
00:03:46  special in quotation marks agent Victor croocked who was personally sworn in by the Queen when he was 15 years old and that was incredible I'm here
00:03:56  tonight to intellectually bitch-slap my opponent I'm looking forward to it thanks for having me on you're welcome okay and then the final
00:04:07  excuse me the final member of the debate final debater tonight which is bev also known as try thinking how are you doing tonight I'm fine thank you very much and
00:04:20  I'm M Bev try thinking I'm just an average dude with a son who ended up getting called a nasty name the end of finding proofs of actual proofs in life
00:04:36  so thank you you've helped all of you nice what we look forward to that proof oh you plan on presenting some of that tonight correct yeah all right well as
00:04:51  I've said already I am about to mute myself and allow you guys to have this conversation uh yeah I've already told you you know when I'll be stopping was
00:04:59  just in between rounds or whatever but for the most part I will be quiet Jared will be quiet he'll be keeping himself muted unless he needs to speak up while
00:05:09  you're speaking Bev FTF II will also be quiet Wow there goes our moderator okay he's back good all right so f TF e we have you on mute Bev I'm turning it over
00:05:19  to you you have 10 minutes Jared are you ready I am ready all right sorry just before you start I was told that you were the guy with the pictures so I just
00:05:30  call out the numbers for the pictures right and you you put them on screen for everyone to see what happens yeah okay hold on then are you talking about me or
00:05:40  Jared or yeah that's what they said you oh yeah I guess I'm the only one that has XS yeah I'll be listening in let me get the debate links Oh
00:05:49  yeah and you have them numbered already for me right yes yes that is right okay can you stop wrong yeah that's not a problem so I'll leave my mic unmuted but
00:05:59  I'll just jump in when you need me to okay so yes let me pull this up give me one second
00:06:07  I'm not watching the YouTube cuz I'm gonna just go so you're like yeah that's not what you oh yeah yeah give me this uh I'm just trying to great that's too
00:06:17  big okay there we go alright now let me pull that up on V mix everybody in the crowd can see what you're talking about [Music]
00:06:34  when you start your presentation but it's ready to go babe okay geez okay start off first of all we have to start off very basics of
00:06:47  geometry and that is this straight line well well yeah yeah let's go with a straight line we'll deal with the logic later a straight line by definition
00:06:57  cannot be curved it has to be everything that a curved line isn't in order to be a straight line to be able to differentiate between the toe straight
00:07:10  and curved there has to be a difference and the difference is a straight line is everything that a curved line isn't so taking that for granted but you say that
00:07:22  a vertical line is a straight line anyway so within the postulates of Euclidean geometry number one that a straight line may be drawn from any one
00:07:36  point to another point it's pretty self-evident that's terminated straight line may be produced to any length in a straight
00:07:46  line just means that you can extend a straight line for any length and it'll still be a straight line and then the circle one so Graham can
00:07:55  you move to number two picture now please and I'll carry on explaining and I hope you'll just do that so you've got a vertical now um a horizontal and a
00:08:08  vertical are 90 degrees opposed they call it perpendicular now if he's pictured to up which should be definition ten of Euclid's elements that
00:08:22  explains I'll read it out when a straight line standing on another straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another
00:08:31  each of the angles is called a right angle and the straight line which stands on the other is called a perpendicular to it so basically what that states is
00:08:42  that a line standing on another line that they call perpendicular is has right angles it's pretty self-evident what I mean that's just Euclidean
00:08:54  geometry everybody knows this from the axis of a graph X&Y and they are perpendicular to each other okay so you've got the the the vertical and the
00:09:11  horizontal now if we change them to give them a real-life vertical would become a plumb line and the horizontal would be called a level we so vertical is
00:09:30  perpendicular to horizontal and the plumb line is perpendicular to the level so that's reality how reality works and how reality relates to Euclidean
00:09:45  geometry and so geometry the actual word means Geo Metro earth measurement and what I've just explained to you is how the vertical and the horizontal relate
00:10:03  to reality through the working tools that everybody uses the plumb-bob are on the level now the best way to work a plumb bob if
00:10:18  you're after a vertical is just to hold a weight on a string and a level and the most natural level is called the water level and that's the one everybody's
00:10:31  used for centuries I would suggest that the Egyptians used the water level when they were doing that their work so in reality you've got the level so if the
00:10:51  water level is horizontal then can you swap to picture number three please this is a what I choose to call and I call it my modus tollens so if if the earth is
00:11:12  the spherical object P then the surface of liquid water must be curved must be curved Q now the water level the tool establishes a horizontal plane can you
00:11:30  put picture number six up I'm hoping that there's a coming on 15:06 is it's a water level yeah now that is water level the tool and it says the water level is
00:11:49  any device utilizing the surface of liquid water to establish a horizontal plane of reference shows a picture of it up there
00:11:59  it's just a tube with to measure vials at the end of it and the line that the water level comes to and between the two is known as a horizontal plane all the
00:12:13  way between the two that I highlighted it a bit at the bottom that says that what two levels have been used for many years the water
00:12:24  level is lower tech than a laser level obviously because it's been used before the laser levels but it can be more accurate over long distances and works
00:12:36  without a sight line it when builders the user on-site all the time it's handy because you can go around corners with it you can't go round corners with the
00:12:46  normal level but with a water level you can so it can we flip back to number three which is this is my water level test now there are all different colors
00:13:03  these levels and it might take you a bit of time and it may be take me a bit of time to explain it and I probably haven't got the time but you can see by
00:13:12  the layout of these particular water levels and they would establish a horizontal and they would show or proof that the water level has to be
00:13:26  horizontal and there's no way these levels could work on a curved surface with the water level curve it impossible so can you put up picture seven please
00:13:42  and this is an example of you've got a teacher on Twitter that likes to take my drawings and transpose them into this don't know what you call it your your
00:13:56  globe version of what would happen so cheese she's took it upon herself to do this picture she put a camera at the side I don't know why but it to show
00:14:08  that the horizontals between the water levels that she's drawn and you have three different horizontals on that Center vertical which sort of
00:14:24  violates the axioms of Euclidean geometry or it just violates that everybody's understanding of a vertical and a horizontal being perpendicular to
00:14:35  each other obviously not in this drawer in and that is what my water level and thing would go to show I am sorry to interrupt you do you have two minutes
00:14:52  remaining which means you have gone eight minutes and I know I'm pretty close to to getting through the end how much more time would you need just last
00:15:03  two minutes I'll be fine I'm nearly till now okay and and this is going to be actual evidence yeah yeah we just been going over it what was it with that if
00:15:17  there's so far I've heard postulations and formations not actual evidence okay let's see what okay well can you put the Celeste
00:15:33  picture up there I'm great okay it's up now this these are three quotes that have been made and by different people and one of them elicited a very strange
00:15:55  reaction from quite a few people it's probably still goes on today but the other one that the one that says one person's horizontal is another person's
00:16:06  vertical it's just a question I'd like to throw out you know just to see whether what you think of that and also if if somebody was to say I'm a teacher
00:16:17  that teaches students when axioms apply and when they don't also another statement that may be worth having a little bit of a look
00:16:29  / and thank you very much I concede the rest of my time well thank you very much Bev if you don't mind Jared would you please mute Bev so
00:16:42  during the 10 minutes while ft Fe has an opportunity opportunity to present his evidence FTA you can unmute ft Fe - please yeah thank you
00:16:54  FD fe are you ready to present your evidence for the sphericity of the earth yeah absolutely okay you want some does that present
00:17:04  yeah you mix right yeah that you need to watch the YouTube Ustream for my evidence because it will be going through there right just tell me when to
00:17:17  start oh you're good to go you're being shared right now all right let me also time a recent and ready when you are
00:17:26  okay if the earth is flat then there are certain things that are impossible that happened that we observe let's start with Miles Davis's observations of a
00:17:37  curve the camera height being 210 meters above sea level that red line which is the top of the for road bridge is also 210 meters above
00:17:49  sea level that gives you an eye level reference those hills in the background there are actually 500 meters in elevation above
00:17:57  sea level there is no law perspective or anything that can make something fall below eye level so what you're seeing here is something that is completely
00:18:09  impossible if the earth is flat it's nothing to do with peaks and valleys it's height above sea level refa is the reference to reusing sea level is the
00:18:21  data on here and the high above sea level of all these things that you're saying on the screen now is impossible to see on the flat earth but that's not
00:18:30  the only observations from that spot if he turns around 180 degrees and looks the other way he gets another good observation but is completely impossible
00:18:38  on the Flat Earth again the camera height being 210 meters above sea level and in the video that the the one of these is from he actually shows the
00:18:46  plaque where he is our Tareq and Lord that shows that it's 210 metres above sea level so there's nothing dodgy going on so again the camera is 210 metres
00:18:55  above sea level hopes a monument there on the left the top of it is 210 metres above sea level those mountains you see in the distance
00:19:02  or roughly a thousand metres above sea level you know in the order of five times higher above sea level than the camera level and the reference point of
00:19:15  eyeline of what your eye level is hope the monument there there is no way that observation could happen on a flat earth the one on the right Benham
00:19:26  Mountain it is over a thousand meters a thousand 11 meters at the summit yet falls below the eye line of 210 metres absolutely 100% impossible if the earth
00:19:39  is flat like that there simply is no way that that could happen if the earth is flat so we can then move on to an observation like this
00:19:50  where sunlight can lay off the bottom court cast a shadow on the bottom of crowds from a mountain the only way that could happen is if the Sun was below the
00:20:03  level of the mountain that is impossible if the earth is flat and the Sun is above us absolutely 100% impossible however a globe this works perfectly on
00:20:14  our model in fact this can only really work if we are on something that is rotating away from the source of light and it's a sphere there's no way that
00:20:23  this can happen on a flat Rafi it's just simply impossible now if we want to talk about plumb and a parallel on everything then a great observation is you just get
00:20:37  the page art you know a real world observation I mean because that's what I'm doing there I'm sending real world observations of the evidence of the
00:20:45  shape of the earth and certain structures have to take it into account the verrazano-narrows bridge in new york is a suspension bridge and it is
00:20:56  so large that even though the two towers of the Venice air Narrows Bridge are plumb the Joey wanted on the tops of the towers are one and 5/8 5/8 inches
00:21:09  further apart than the bottom of the towers meaning that the zeniff angles will the sum of the senate angles will be greater than 180 degrees again again
00:21:19  this is literally only possible if if the earth is is a sphere and also this is a demonstration as it's over water the it's in the water curves because the
00:21:32  water will be plumb are all pointed to to the where it is yet at the two points where it's plumb the top of it is larger meaning the the water underneath it must
00:21:44  be curving so again there's real world observation that the earth is not flat now another good one is from the dog cam let me just mute that so on the dog cam
00:21:59  they actually have two cameras they have one that is fisheye and I'll just find the bit where it shows that all right so you've got this camera on the on the cam
00:22:14  which is fisheye which shows as you go over the verts at look at the center the the surface becomes concave and convex but there's another camera on the cam
00:22:25  that isn't fitting and you can tell this because it actually crosses the center line several times there you go yet the surfaced always stays convex as we would
00:22:36  expect and what they've done is they've compressed the image on the right to exaggerate the the curvature to show you that it's there and what we get is
00:22:45  something that actually matches the globe predictions of curvature exactly the based on the height that the dog cam is and as you can see there is quite
00:22:55  clear curvature when you're high enough to see it and you're using something that doesn't have fisheye this isn't fish guy here crosses the center line
00:23:03  several times so more evidence there that the earth is a sphere it's completely impossible for that to happen if the earth isn't a sphere now
00:23:13  there is something that's impossible on the Flat Earth again the actually makes complete sense on the globe and also I've lost where that picture is one
00:23:24  Cirque here we go this simple observation okay the black lines show the exact position of the Terminator the division of night and day
00:23:34  on the equinoxes flat earthers claim the reason we have nighttime is because the Sun is too far away to see because the earth is flat not because it says the
00:23:43  red Lighting's indicate the distances from Tokyo in Boston to the Sun and are shorter than the yellow lines indicating the distances
00:23:49  from perth amboy in this area to the sun yeah it is night in Tokyo and Boston well it's day in Perth and Buenos Aires this is an observation that's impossible
00:24:00  if the earth is flat however you put that observation onto the globe and it makes complete sense there's things that are completely impossible if the air
00:24:09  if the earth is flat that make complete and utter sense if the earth is a globe observations of things going behind curvature are quite easy to get I
00:24:21  know the flatterers have been banning about this as the Black Swan but they don't understand refraction in in the slightest and when you look at the flat
00:24:31  earthers video that they put about which is this one the interesting thing is if you read the notes from the person that took these observations he spent
00:24:39  literally a year trying to go out and get observations like this and there is only a very few times where the observation turned out that the horizon
00:24:49  looked like it was behind the platforms 99.9% of the time the platform habitat fell below the sea level quite easily so again this is something that flat refers
00:25:02  can try and say as possible on the Flat Earth but the effects of refraction have been quantified we know what refraction is and how it works if you know the
00:25:12  lapse rate which is the the change in temperature over a distance then you can calculate the coefficient of refraction and it's quite easy to see that when you
00:25:22  actually program in the conditions that would make refraction that this observation the flat refers put about is possible on the flat earth
00:25:29  however this sorry is possible on the globe earth however this observation is not possible on the flat earth because refraction doesn't work backwards unless
00:25:39  there's some super weird temperature inversion duct and again the person that took these observations most of the time and got this rather than the other thing
00:25:48  Earth's not flat it can't be flat there's things that are impossible if the earth is flat the have never had an explanation so that is my evidence and I
00:25:59  will pass the rest of my time back to the moderator all right okay great can you please unmute Bev imager and go ahead and unmute FTF II as well well
00:26:14  this is the rebuttal portion correct we are giving Bev a chance to work but the presentation that Craig just yeah yeah okay yeah you're right
00:26:25  leave f TF e muted I'm sorry you're right leave Alfie Fe muted unmute Bev Bev are you prepared to refute the evidence that he put forward yeah yeah
00:26:37  well refute yeah yeah and I'd like to question the the Miles Davis bridge picture and as far as I know we we don't have any details on that picture as in
00:26:53  where he was when he took the picture and all that because we have people that are willing to try and recreate that and have a look at it and as far as I know
00:27:04  we don't know any of the details for it so like we we would like to have the details for that picture as in where picture was taken from what just just
00:27:19  the details like that and then we can send somebody to try and recreate it because as far as we know Craig just uses that picture quite a lot and seems
00:27:29  to state it and and I'll I don't personally think he understands what perspective is when he looks at that bridge when he does like
00:27:37  all level patan well we'll leave that we I would like to request the details for the Miles Davis suspension bridge picture please John come on I'm sorry
00:27:50  babe did you my god let me let me just interrupt for one second did you want FTF fee to respond at that point with the details if he has them no he won't
00:27:58  have the details right now because at some point I would just like to make it be known that we would like me and the team or people I know would
00:28:10  like to have the details for that picture so we can go and recreate it okay okay well I guess so we have a chance to respond to that when you guys
00:28:18  discuss back and forward now don't count this time against Tim Jared government I'm not I have pause but when you stepped in so you're still heavy
00:28:29  okay I'm sorry good look okay and I'd also like to report against the the claims of the Black Swan The Horizon only 99 percent I think was mentioned
00:28:41  I'm not having that be MSL B has been back there four or five times and he's took the pictures and the horizon has been in the distance behind the part of
00:28:55  our platforms quite a few times it's been replicated and done many times now it's not just the one-off okay that's me done okay
00:29:09  is that all the robotoid you wanted for his evidence I went to the toilet off by three so I didn't hear most of it I mean I I think I heard something about water
00:29:17  he may have said it curved but I mean that's ridiculous so not to be intruding on your personal privacy but did you take a Riley or a Nathan
00:29:27  I haven't kind of clearly talking about well Riley is a human you piss a Nathan is when you you know when your don't understand
00:29:41  what you talking about anyways so here I have unmuted ftse for one purpose to give you an opportunity to fully address the presentation
00:30:00  FTF e would you like to just have a brief summary of the portion that Bev appears to have missed that way he can decide whether or not he wants to remit
00:30:13  the remaining 8 minutes of his time or if he would like to about the portions that he has missed no he didn't forget to rebuy so I'm taking that as he lost
00:30:26  he if he wants to go to the toilet during my presentation then that's his problem because he doesn't understand the debate
00:30:32  so we're just I'm just gonna tell you guys he doesn't understand anything and we can move on we can talk about it in the open discussion I can bring it back
00:30:40  up then but no all right well then let me reset the timer and I will let you know when your to directly address his presentation will begin give me one
00:30:52  moment ready when you alright well first of all I'll start with the quote book some other people that he brought up that
00:31:06  were irrelevant to the shape of the earth and that's all I'm gonna say about them they're irrelevant to the shape of the earth I never said it
00:31:11  it was nothing I brought up so I don't need to address other people's points I'm here to address beb's points so I'm just learning more the things he said
00:31:19  about what other people said then we get to his test which was apparently a crayon drawing of some water levels I'm not sure if ever understands what the
00:31:31  word test means drawing a picture is not a test and in fact you know I can actually go back into my evidence to rebut his claim about plumb and
00:31:43  everything being like that because again the Venice arrow Narrows Bridge has two bits that are plumb the actual let me get it back up on the screen yes so the
00:32:00  the Ben Sara Narrows Bridge has to plumb structures on it the 207 meters above sea level bridge towers the bits that hold the suspension cables they are
00:32:12  plumb they were designed as plumb you can find the structure analysis and everything from when it was built through this webpage and they are plumb
00:32:20  yet the top of the towers are one and 5/8 further apart than the bottom of the towers meaning that these Enif angles add up to greater than 180 degrees
00:32:33  that's impossible if the earth is anything other than a sphere or at least curved in some way it's definitely not flat and also shows that the water
00:32:41  underneath it is curving because the water will be level at all points the word level Bev seems to confuse the the tool level with the word level because
00:32:54  if you want to talk about what the word level means then we need to talk about the adjective which is the physical describing word and according to the
00:33:04  merriam-webster dictionary standard since 18:23 the word level means to the objective of it conform to the curvature
00:33:12  of the liquid parts of Earth's surface meaning that level is perpendicular to whatever the earth surfaces at the surface of the water is at that point
00:33:23  and it's curved as evidenced in the Venice area Narrows Bridge because the towers coming out of the water have greater zeniff angles than 180 degrees
00:33:32  so it's impossible if the earth is flat than that so that rebuts his misunderstanding of what the word level is and well if we're talking about
00:33:43  geometry a cool story bro but non-euclidean geometry is a branch of mathematics and is what we use to calculate things on a sphere the
00:33:53  spherical trigonometry and in non Euclidean geometry a straight line also known as a curved segment is the shortest distance between two points in
00:34:03  non Euclidean geometry a straight line is curved it's just in the U you can spit postulate doesn't apply in non Euclidean geometry as the first
00:34:16  twenty-eight propositions view cleared and the elements do not require the use of parallel postulates or anything equivalent to it they are all true
00:34:22  statements and absolute geometry to obtain a non Euclidean geometry the parallel postulate or its equivalent must be replaced by its negation and I
00:34:30  don't know why he has this blind spot for what non Euclidean geometry is it blows my mind but non Euclidean geometry is a branch of mathematics a Euclidean
00:34:42  geometry isn't all that there is so he didn't present any evidence for the shape of the earth not none at all not not one bit so I'm just kind of going
00:34:53  over his misunderstandings of things and I think I'm done all right Jarrid either I am and now we can go into the moderated back-and-forth and to
00:35:11  keep things as equal as possible we will allow Bev to ask the first direct question to think do you understand which non-euclidean geometry you keep
00:35:32  referencing yes the stuff that you used to calculate things on a sphere what would you know the name of it well you spit up spiracle trigonometry
00:35:45  but it's irrelevant to the shape of your if this discussion was about the shape of the earth but spherical a spherical trigonometry is Euclidean geometry based
00:35:54  and see every culture non-euclidean geometry right it's a thing if you're talking about spherical geometry is that the geometry you talking about yeah and
00:36:05  I ask you a question dost non-euclidean geometry exist I'll get there yeah yeah yeah cool then we can move on because family but in jointery exist so yes very
00:36:14  cool geometry is an example of non-euclidean geometry but you have a little bit of a problem because it's in the geometry of the two-dimensional
00:36:26  surface of a sphere and can you see the problem there no not at all non Euclidean geometry is how you calculate things there yeah you know
00:36:39  two-dimensional surface of a sphere looks like yeah that would be a topographical representation but like if you took a topographical representation
00:36:47  of the cube or it would basically be a rectangle well an oddly shaped rectangle with kirt bit so that's off and that would with you be a flat representation
00:36:55  of the surface of a cue ball it doesn't mean that a cue ball isn't curved so yeah cool that's your question asked I'll move on to mine fight fight hold on
00:37:07  hold on fight stick to one topic let's hear through their topic and then we'll move two years after that sorry I didn't want to
00:37:12  but I do want you guys to finish this topic you realize two-dimensional is length and breadth are you saying that you can't calculate things on a sphere
00:37:25  I'm saying that spherical geometry is the geometry just on the surface of a sphere you do understand that don't you yes but it's a curved sphere yeah you
00:37:41  know there's many title non Euclidean clients elliptic geometry in the movie yep in non Euclidean geometry a straight
00:37:50  line or is a curved segment but it is anything geometry that's what a straight line is in chemical geometry it whatever you want to call it a straight line or
00:37:59  not is is not is is irrelevant because we may not be talking to your minds be straight lines become curves in non Euclidean geometry
00:38:08  it's a enemy well yeah I do be books quite a lot actually can we establish which geometry you are non Euclidean geometry non-euclidean geometry which is
00:38:27  what I'm talking about straight lines can curve it's it's simple as that sounds like an oxymoron to me I mean you can say that all you
00:38:36  like but none of your misunderstood is is that ly relevant to the shape of the earth when we can actually physically see things that prove well true not true
00:38:47  because science wasn't proofing we can physically see things that are impossible or if the earth is flat and if you want to talk about the
00:38:55  observation of Miles Davis I actually said in my presentation that is which we always tweet your questions oh no no no we haven't we haven't exhausted this
00:39:06  Craig install you've just tried to gloss over it yeah because it's irrelevant to the shape of the earth it is no no this conversation is about evidence for the
00:39:18  shape of the earth right right because I presented evidence machine you didn't and clothes let's let's talk about evidence for the taking of them
00:39:26  greg patello second let them respond can i state once again the geometry means geo earth Metra measurement earth measurement so the geometry that we are
00:39:46  talking about has everything to do with the earth has it not it's your claim that the word geometry means the earth is flat no you're saying
00:40:00  look my recollection is that there is ways to calculate things on a sphere and we use non Euclidean geometry to do that it's vertical geometry you would use to
00:40:12  calculate things on the surface of us yes which is part of non-euclidean geometry yeah yeah and Samaritan fits yes Surya isn't yes the surface of a
00:40:24  sphere whose dimensional surface of a sphere what is the two-dimensional surface of a sphere how's way that is where spherical
00:40:34  geometry takes place crazy surface of a sphere is 3d right yeah you feel like you can do you agree that do you agree that the sphere is 3d yes it isn't okay
00:40:52  so how do you calculate things on the surface of the 3d object how do you calculate yes how do you calculate distances on the surface of a 3d object
00:41:03  um well I I would get as the 3d object and measure it I don't think I'd need to calculate it so cool and we've measured the shape of the earth that it might
00:41:14  might my question was using which Gianna like that my question was how do you calculate something on the surface of a sphere
00:41:26  but let's say I mean refined my question how do you calculate students on the surface of a sphere because there is ways to do it yeah
00:41:36  so using spherical geometry yeah cool so spherical geometry is a thing which means we can calculate distances on the surface of a sphere because non
00:41:44  Euclidean geometry exists and in learn Euclidean geometry you replace the last postulate of new kids postulates with it and the negation of that
00:41:52  no no you'll have to do way more than that for spherical geometry you can't leave this first too so in Kenya well again says are you
00:42:06  great like the two lines can't enclose the space that would have to go wouldn't it are you claiming that there is no way to calculate distances on the surface of
00:42:14  a 3d object no why would I say that geometry which is the geometry onto the surface of a sphere cool yeah move on then right no I have I've covered that
00:42:32  that is my response to you you can use spherical geometry to calculate distances on the surface of a sphere that's my answer to your question let
00:42:39  let's move on right so let's go to my Miles Davis observation and you want to get that team you're gonna get down there and put it up for everyone Zoe so
00:42:51  they can be clear yeah okay so Bev look I'll grab the picture and I'll get it ready to be put up let's go ahead and move on to the next yeah let's go ahead
00:42:59  and move on to the next topic and we'll get back to that once I have the picture ready okay fgfe go ahead alright so you said that there's never been any new
00:43:11  data regarding my latest observations I mean if you look as far as I know well I mean let him finish research then the video that it is from actually has the
00:43:22  details of where he took it and he has personally invited many many photographers to come and do that observation with him all of them have
00:43:29  refused it is of a hill known as Terrapin law and the exact coordinates are given by Miles Davis quite freely and are easily verifiable so
00:43:40  I would like you to address the evidence rather than just glossing over I don't know if that's true okay so the position he's in and when
00:43:50  he's looking out and he's looking out using a level and you say he's the same height as the so are you assuming a horizontal level line of eyesight yes
00:44:02  I'm not assuming that I am saying that the camera height is 210 meters and the appeal line of the top of the fourth road bridge is 210 meters
00:44:12  that gives you an eye level that gives you a reference point and that hangs on for reference that means that nothing can do to perspective fall below eye
00:44:22  level it could shrink into eye level but perspective could never make something full below at eye level yet in the images that I present let me get them up
00:44:32  on screen you to look at the huge future stream in in this first one you have here horizontal reference if you want to call it that you have what your eye
00:44:47  level is 210 meters to 210 meters okay yeah if you continue that horizontal playing out there are 500 meters in elevation above sea level
00:45:00  full below that horizontal plane meaning that that is a tangent to the sphere okay his eye level at this point is a tangent to the sphere and those the
00:45:10  mountains are 500 meters plus in elevation above sea level yet they fall below a horizontal reference and then if we go through the next one it shows it
00:45:22  even more this is 380 degrees at the same spot and the camera height I have 210 meters above sea level hopes and monument is 210 meters above
00:45:32  sea level yet those mountains in the background of all roughly a thousand meters above sea level the one on the right is a thousand metres above sea
00:45:39  level yeah even though they're on the order of five times higher in elevation above sea level they fall below the tangent of his
00:45:48  eye line that isn't if the earth is flat dungeon of his eyeline yes I'm talking about a tangent to the sphere birth okay okay can I just
00:46:00  like cuz i'm i'm seeing this blind and i'm sort of listening to you as you're talking so you've got the guy um hood on the mountain and he's 210 feet did you
00:46:12  say 210 metres above sea level right so he's 210 meters and he's looking at the bridge which is how far away from him for fraud bridge is from there about
00:46:26  three kilometers i believe an athlete check the actual data breaches 210 yeah the middle python of the Forth Road Bridge the the top of it is 210 meters
00:46:40  above sea level okay which is obviously he is also 210 meters above sea yes so it's a sea level assume to be horizontal because you
00:46:50  assumed that your eyesight across the top of the bridge was horizontal see local is the the mean datsan point meaning him that that is the curve of
00:47:01  the earth in this case so that levels curve to put the so when you say it's 210 meters you mean do you mean actually 210 meters or do you mean I mean the 110
00:47:14  meters above sea level it's right singular yeah but that's do you mean that that sea levels like curved away though from his the point he was up at
00:47:24  210 meters no I am simply I am simply saying that his height and the height of that bridge RBF 210 meters above sea level
00:47:33  yes we are using smiling we using sea level as a reference here right yeah but I need to know what the reference is because the if you're working in surveys
00:47:42  terms when you work with the datum the datum would be horizontal and then you can work not when it behave as sea level all right so that's 11 listen well again
00:47:53  the word level means to conform to the curvature of the liquid parts of a service right how did you assume that well then the guy was on the mountain
00:48:01  and he was looking at the thing that was 210 meters that that line was horizontal because that is the the reference point that is his eye level
00:48:11  right and if you continued that 210 meters out here then it would be a tangent to the sphere of Earth but be bridge with sorry none like this away be
00:48:24  a bit yeah the town because it's curved why not next the the bridge and no listen to one saying the bridge and hoped and Monument in these observations
00:48:35  are not very far away okay they are you know you you have one degree of curve to every 69 miles so what we're looking at here is a curve in the water level the
00:48:48  if you take the circumference of the earth being as 25 thousand miles in circumference then one degree of that is 69 miles okay okay and that's like all
00:48:58  right and that I have in the water level no it's I'm talking about the circumference of the earth one degree of the circumference of the earth would be
00:49:07  seized in my mind we here assuming it's a sphere there for this observation you I am doing the maths based on a sphere so you need to listen all the same right
00:49:16  yeah now the Hopeton Monument and the bridge are less than six nine miles away a lot less you know which means that they are way less than one degree off
00:49:30  one degree would not show up as much in this observation degree dropped from the horizontal a one degree curve away from him right
00:49:42  so what a care phone what in relation to the surface of the earth based on the word level with the curve is to the surface isn't it so yes how would you
00:49:53  max whatever with in relation to a curve what what's that how does that work you don't understand how a sphere works that's that's strange
00:50:02  I know geometry isn't it are you talking about the volume okay listen this is surface of the earth we are talking about here is curved okay so his 207
00:50:16  sorry I didn't use usually surface if these surface a 210 meters above sea level is directly away from the center of the earth points around the earth
00:50:27  right when when you're using sea level okay directly when he was walking and you've got this Bobby's on human it was like a horizontal curved no I'm saying
00:50:39  I'm saying that his eye line here to 210 meters the degree difference of that the top of the tower to him is so little that it is still a tangent would still
00:50:53  touch them right the the it would be like 0.04 degrees I think sorry do you not know what a tangent is yeah to but I'm just one what something was a
00:51:05  tangent we are looking out active worried what what is a tangent it's it's just a straight line isn't it a straight line to what it's just straight like to
00:51:16  what what you mean to what it just it goes on it goes both ends so if you put that on the sphere it would be a tangent to the sphere right oh well it's a
00:51:27  straight line isn't it yeah so it's a line this sort of touching it so like the straight line here actually 210 meters above sea level
00:51:36  looking out with a straight line not curved AJ okay so see the top of the bridge as 210 metres above sea level because the distance away is so small
00:51:48  the degree that it would be facing away if it was plumb is negligible so the tangent will still from his eyesight touch the top of the bridge now you
00:51:58  continue that time job now horizontal stuff because it I don't know the same height and the other ones on a sphere wouldn't it like be a bit lower out the
00:52:09  way that that's what I've said other away it's such a small amount because it is six four nine my host that would make make no the eye sight not be horizontal
00:52:20  that by a little bit are you not listening words that are coming out of my mouths it is about 0.04 degrees
00:52:29  difference that is negligible the tangent of his eyesight looking out to that the top of the bridge the transient of his eyesight
00:52:37  yes Bev stop interrupting me when there's a straight line isn't it your I say yes well why why do you keep a stream in a circle it's a straight line
00:52:48  on its though I'm not assuming anything I am so long you're saying he's on my site is it tangent just yeah a straight line or plane that touches a curve or
00:53:02  surface where's the curve he's looking at a bloody bridge yes and the curve like why are you seeing you mat then how are the
00:53:14  hills in the distance below the eye level of the Ted clip with the cans sorry perspectives doesn't make something fall below eye level what
00:53:26  perspective does not make something fall below I like it makes things vanishing to the vanishing point isn't that what perspective does it wouldn't make it go
00:53:34  below it would maybe sink into that line but it would never go below the eye line they would never go below what your eye levels if you ever add a word with an
00:53:44  artist and ask their mouth a year do you know the calculation for perspective this is a calculation for it is there yeah
00:53:54  do you know what you're not just sort of draw things in to a vanishing point in addition you're not just sort of great rebuttal Bev I'm asking you a direct
00:54:05  question do you know the calculation for perspectives I wouldn't know no but you like it yes it's alpha equals two times the arc tan of G over 2 R where alpha is
00:54:14  the angular size of the object G is the distance to the object and R is the actual height of the object so alpha equal to x at time zero to R will give
00:54:24  you how big something should look based on how far away is okay okay right and that that will never allow something to fall below
00:54:37  what your eye level is that's not how perspective works perspective if we're looking at when we've got what an eye level is here okay it is a straight
00:54:45  horizontal line from his eye sight to the top of that bridge stop talking I'd never said the word level high level his eye level is
00:54:58  horizontal yeah I love who isn't level I level by his I love what he's looking at in a straight line yeah horizontal from his eye yes oh all
00:55:13  right so is straight his eyes that are looking out straight sees the top of the bridge just 210 meters yet the things in the distance are below what I level is
00:55:23  prospective cannot make something full below eye level okay yeah so if based on that basic bit of knowledge how is this observation and
00:55:34  this observation possible if the earth is flat can I just clarify two things or if he's like okay his eye level 210 meters yeah can we say exactly 210
00:55:50  meters yeah that's the okay yeah the height of the bridge exactly 210 meters above sea level the the middle pillar or before throat British yes and is that at
00:56:03  the same level horizontal level as his eyes the straight line from the top from his eyes to the top of the bridge me what 210 meters is okay the word level
00:56:18  can is conforming to the curvature of the liquid parts of her surface right for his eye level in this case a horizontal plane yeah it's looking out
00:56:26  and is seeing the bridge the top of the bridge of 210 meters above sea level if the earth is a sphere based on the math that we say it is that bridge will
00:56:36  be the pillar of that bridge will be leaning away about 0.04 degrees which would not be noticeable and would still make the top of that bridge match his
00:56:46  eye level Eve if the earth was curved that's why he uses the reference point that is relatively close to him yet the
00:56:52  mountains in the distance are a lot further away they're like over the Firth of Forth and into Edinburgh again I can give you all the topographical maps and
00:57:01  everything so you can check this out yourself those hills in the distance for below that straight horizontal line which is impossible if the earth is flat
00:57:12  okay chemicals just go for one more clarifier and he's I level above is above sea level as well isn't it you know it's 210 meters that's yes like I'm
00:57:24  crazy when sea level are different things but that's a vertical height above sea level yes and also for the bridge the top of
00:57:35  the bridge is a vertical height above sea level of 210 meters yes thank you and you know we use human Euclidian geometry for this I am NOT assuming any
00:57:52  geometry I'm simply showing I am simply showing an observation that is impossible if the earth is flat with the dimensions that you've just give me and
00:58:01  all of the verticals and the horizontals that you just give me you've done a very good job of explaining that it's all horizontal the sea level is a horizontal
00:58:14  know--he sea level is Nora's on from his position - yay did you know no I said his height above sea level yes he hiding yeah which is directly 210
00:58:30  metres above sea level and again that pillar is directly 210 metres above sea level and if you were to put a plumb line where he is an a plumb line where
00:58:42  that bridge is and measured as anything goes they would add up to greater than 180 degree by now they wouldn't they they worked just like in the Venice area
00:58:50  Narrows Bridge do you know do you know what as any thankless yeah it's the angle from the like point the to the to the surface so until you add
00:59:00  up if you have to add up the two zeniff angles of the the point where the plumb bob is at the bridge to the point of the plumb bob where that where he is they
00:59:09  would add up to greater than 180 degrees you don't know where it is anything less today I do and I just told you we've just told me something but that wasn't
00:59:19  what does anything Alice so I don't know yeah yeah so she made the claim that he doesn't know what a Zenith angle is if you're in an
00:59:30  explanation of it you want me to I forego your claiming he was wrong okay well yeah I'd love to I'd love to explain to people what what
00:59:41  is and like I hope you believe me and the zenith is the point directly above your head it is a personal position it is a yeah yeah okay so that is yours any
01:00:04  now a Zenith angle is a an angle from that position to some think yes yes so a zennith angle can be anything Connor
01:00:22  it depends what you're looking at I mean does any it's your first you know what do you know what the like the actual word Zenith means like Zenith is
01:00:37  literally disappointing to solve your head I just fix finally well do you messing out an important part in the actual definition because when you look
01:00:43  at the definition zennith it is the is the zenith is an imaginary point directly above a particularly location on an imaginary
01:00:51  celestial sphere yeah there's any issue is that yes in scientific context as NF is the direction of reference for measuring the zeniff angle the angle
01:01:04  between the direction of interest a star and the zennith yeah so that you've just you've just explained that you were wrong if
01:01:15  there's anything goes without the some of the same angles would be greater than 180 degrees if you're looking at a star would decrease just right this
01:01:24  observation and in this observation there's anything are the angles between the two points of observation right unclear where you were looking at like
01:01:35  you were looking at the top of the bridge well yeah right well that wouldn't that be horizontal you said it was horizontal so how would that be more
01:01:43  than a hundred ninety degrees what you're talking about because you need to take the angle of YouTube or like your Zenith to them oriental that's nice yeah
01:01:53  okay yeah it's a right angle listen to calculate the zenith angle you would need to do fine but okay and if you did that then you would get an angle with
01:02:02  Zenit new Zenith angles the Sun with them would be greater than 180 degrees because one of them is curved away meaning the it gives you a greater angle
01:02:12  yeah yeah I think you you don't really understand geometry yeah I do and don't think you understand me you're a male thing about failed pretty hard here
01:02:25  Craig because you've but literally given you the definition of Xenophon what the the bridge is it the same horizontal level above sea level
01:02:36  how's your eyesight so they are on the same horizontal now if they are the same height then the horizontal that they are on must be the same horizontal the sea
01:02:50  level must be horizontal if you're the Orion of eyesight from your eye is horizontal and again the the angle deviation of those pillars compared to
01:03:02  his particular like position is about 0.04 degrees yeah you thinking about them leaning the wrong way you're no I'm saying intervening it away from you
01:03:13  right so here it's just you talking about top one second right if is looking at that bridge in the distance the bridge pillar that bridge
01:03:24  will be slightly leaning away from him okay so if you measured the angle of the braid they not I don't Ericsson amigo well they did but the earth is a sphere
01:03:33  and this comes back to my other observation that you completely glossed over that the Venice area Narrows Bridge which has to plumb structures has the
01:03:47  the tops are further apart than the bottoms so what what does that say when both those sturm structures are completely plumb with that main
01:03:57  intersecting horizontals like listen both of the towers of the bridge yeah are plumb the tops of the bridges are 1 and 5/8 inches further apart than
01:04:12  the bottoms of the bridges yep now if they're both plumb yet the top is forever a partner and the bottom what does that suggest can you put a picture
01:04:22  number 7 please cuz yeah give me one second I'll have that up and I'll let you know when it's ready okay so the these um bridges are splayed
01:04:36  out words are they it slightly yes right okay now you say they are vertical Merapi yes yeah they are splayed out which though yes they are plumb yet the
01:04:51  top is further apart than the bottom and that's not like a mistake within though the measurements you couldn't be mistaken no I'm not mistaken I'm just
01:05:03  going off of the new the people that made the bridge and what what geometry would you presume they use in any commentary you know I'm human any I'm
01:05:15  not presuming any geometry I'm simply making the observation that somebody else has made an observation told you the people that make the bridge yes I'm
01:05:26  ongoing even people that made the bridge open the people that made the bridge those eggs I've made those pillars plumb okay yeah you can you can claim it's a
01:05:35  lie and what you're doing right now is the genetic fallacy and I'm just going to ignore it but the fact is that the pillars of the Bennis Aaron marriage
01:05:43  bridge are plumb they are plumb that's how they're made yet no take forever apart and who made yeah they were design nothing right so what what does that
01:06:00  suggest that but one of them isn't vertical or perhaps they both aren't vertical I set the people that made the bridge said it is okay so you realize
01:06:12  he's that picture up again can we have a look at that picture yeah thinking about the picture seven the horizontal perpendicular yeah yeah
01:06:21  you can see the way like if the towers are splayed outwards this with the fact that a horizontal is perpendicular to a vertical right that would require the
01:06:36  two horizontal at the bottom of those bridges to not be the same horizontal because they would intersect somewhere at the middle of the bridge wouldn't he
01:06:49  crane that's that's a nose can you see how that makes you show it and that picture is showing three horizontals happier than that middle vertical is it
01:07:01  is it now yeah yeah how does this explain what we are seeing well that isn't right is it you know when you look at that can you see that there's a bit
01:07:15  of a problem ER with the horizontal and the vertical then they meet slightly off-center there on that image well there's three different horizontals on
01:07:25  that center vertical can you see that there is three separate tangents yes so that that is what would happen if your bridges were splayed out do you get that
01:07:36  yeah yeah what joins okay well us it's the three different horizontals on one vertical so and what was it well two of
01:07:48  the horizontals aren't perpendicular are there they're plumb um you understand that one of the rules within Euclidean geometry yes you kiddin drama she's
01:08:02  irrelevant I'm saying that both of the you know the actual discussion about what you clean geometry rather the actual observation that I am presenting
01:08:11  to you is that to plumb structures deviate more at the top than they do at the bottom but that would sort of go against because surveyors use Euclidean
01:08:23  geometry when they are measuring so I don't think a surveyor made this I'm pretty sure it's brilliant in it yeah but I mean they can't violate the laws
01:08:32  of Euclidean geometry in reality Canley right so you're saying that they physically couldn't build something on the sphere i I'm saying that the
01:08:44  verticals that you say are vertical on that bridge cannot be diverging or in the arch plane prague but it's not a claim the people that made the bridge
01:08:57  yeah had to make it so and you is literally in the measurements when they created at the tops of the pillars were further apart than the bottom yeah but
01:09:11  they were like the tops of further apart and the bottom doesn't mean that verticals insert it may just mean and they not verticals intersecting what I
01:09:23  am saying is that they are plumb well they might not be oh no that is they are known as the Archon clicking are they they are them yeah and tops are further
01:09:37  apart than the bottom this is a real world observation here so that we are clear but I'm I'm saying it's a real world observation that violates
01:09:45  Euclidean geometry you can say that what you want it doesn't change the fact that that's how they built it these structures are plumb yet the top it's
01:09:55  further apart than the bottom what does that suggest I don't know I said the same thing to the main severity of the day and you can't measure non parallel
01:10:11  verticals he'll story bro Euclidean geometry then explain the fact that the plumb parrot the plumb towers of the bridge are further apart at the
01:10:24  top than the bottom explain that then but I have already explained it to you no you haven't a half they know you think you really they haven't they can't
01:10:34  be vertical they are plumb you know what Plumbing's right yeah it means vertical tonight it means perpendicular to the book of gravity but this meter article
01:10:45  okay so so we are not talking past each other both please please define vertical how you are using it sorry you broke hope that so we are
01:11:06  talking past each other these define vertical as you are using ya practic impractical terms he said plump up the it's the position string makes her plumb
01:11:18  bob and I've sort of got a bit of a picture let me let me find it for you you can carry on if you want well our time finally saw the picture is that a
01:11:32  good enough explanation of vertical for you I mean yeah if you want but again those they are vertical they're they're reference frame is that they are
01:11:48  vertical okay yeah even though both of them on a vertical plumbing the tops are further apart than the bottom that's that's like are you willing to stand by
01:12:01  that because I mean I wouldn't make I'd say I'm not I'm not making it I am telling you what the information came from the people that made the bridge
01:12:11  then with the exact words for the notes in the construction say that the main span of the Venice area narrows bridges the curvature taken in the design at the
01:12:22  towers that the towers were plumb yet the tops were one five eight inches further apart than the bottom of the towers though based on that okay they
01:12:37  used they used in Killian they use straight line distances for the measurements right yeah it's all about reference trains each bit of the bridge
01:12:44  has its own reference frame the same in the observation from Miles Davis the the towers that Miles Davis was looking out on the bridge of the for the port road
01:12:53  is its own reference frame and is vertical for itself but when you look further at past the vertical you see things that are falling away which is
01:13:04  not explained by perspective because perspective cannot make something fall below eye level because I mean it's not cool story it's a fact
01:13:16  well perspective perspective cannot make something for below a vertical reference claim of a level okay well Eve you I think you've
01:13:25  been big on maths giving proofs recently haven't you well yeah because that's kind of one of the tenants of science is that okay that's that's where math
01:13:36  that's where proof exists in maps and geometry histology geometry is part of math so yeah he's the geometry can give you proofs Connie it can give you
01:13:47  certain proofs if you apply it correctly okay but again the proofs have to align with real evasion because when you use
01:13:57  mathematics as a proof you are using it to back up an empirical observation of something okay and in this case my empirical observation is the the Venice
01:14:10  area narrow bridge has Plum towers that are further apart at the top than the bottom which is impossible if the earth is flat just saying I don't think it is
01:14:24  is you're a massive cop-out Anna fail in your part because you can go and look at the you've all this structure design they've got links to the people actually
01:14:33  built the bridge and everything you can contact them you can get schematics yourself and check this out before ideally the page that I'm displaying has
01:14:42  all the links on so you can go and do it all yourself okay yeah so you can go and look through the the schematic you're not you're not going to show it and like
01:14:51  presented it now I'm showing you the page that you can get those links from those world what all the references are there okay okay so it's just I've just
01:15:01  put another picture in the chat and it hasn't got a number yet but that's so it sort of goes to show frankly what we're talking about at the minute
01:15:12  give me a one second I'll pull it up for you okay let's know when you've got it it's a it's plumb Bob's and a water level
01:15:26  that's now when you've got it on okay it's up right now right on that border you you have fur you've got definition ten which is I put
01:15:37  up before about its Euclidean geometry about a straight line standing on another straight lines basically the explanation of a perpendicular and which
01:15:49  is represented by the horizontal is represented by the water level either side you can just see there's a little bit of water in there but so that the
01:16:00  horizontal plane between them water levels these that's the horizontal and then you've got three plumb Bob's hanging within that horizontal plane of
01:16:12  reference now I don't know about you but the vertical and the horizontal are a representation of the level and the plumb bob so I would say that when I'm
01:16:25  looking at that then our three verticals that are all perpendicular to the water level which is a horizontal so there's three verticals on a horizontal I let me
01:16:39  ask you a question about that particular image if we are to first a second assume the earth is divided that Bay is the circumference of 25,000 miles an hour
01:16:49  what kind of deviation would you expect between those two plumb levels the only assumptions I'd make other ones within the Posche I'm asking you to just assume
01:17:01  something for me at the moment so that my imagination is terrible I can tell you about the what they are they're all yeah okay so the question is if the
01:17:12  earth the size that we say is with a circumference of 25,000 miles an hour and what is it between the two plumb Bob's at the end there are what a meter
01:17:20  and a half or something yeah I'm not sure how big that is yeah you keep saying that mass and just asking your question what is it about
01:17:29  meter geometry gives you proofs on it Craig answer my question what is it about meter and a half and Bob sorry II keep breaking up is it is that
01:17:40  male do I need to jump in and out nice breaking up you're breaking up a little bit it's discord he's asking is the distance between the two plums on the
01:17:49  outside what do you think the distances between those two meter about a meter meter by meter okay so what kind of deviation would there be if the surface
01:18:01  of the earth is curved with a circumference of 25,000 miles an hour at 25,000 miles sorry if it's what is that if that is one meter
01:18:13  yeah and Europe has in a conference of 25,000 miles what angle of daeviation but with the plums have from each other I couldn't tell you cuz I don't think
01:18:25  I'd be here right well let's say 69 degrees for one mile how many meters is there in a mile it's one degree for every 100 kilometer are
01:18:39  using very cold geometry there I'm just using basic math here so one degree for every variable geometry though I am what did you say charts ones one one
01:18:51  degree for every 111 kilometers so that would be one 111 of a degree that they would be separating from each other so you think you would see that there sorry
01:19:08  here assuming spherical geometry there I am making the assumption that if the earth but you know I'm more using a thought experiment the if the earth has
01:19:19  the circumference that we say it is of 25,000 miles and that is one meter apart with those two plums in so would you be maybe in geometry for this circumference
01:19:31  of this circle the I'm just saying that the that you could mind if I am just saying the circumference of the earth is 25,000 miles so you know you're not
01:19:41  talking hypothetical and you I only idiom a young man's real by fire I am trying to run you through a thought expand
01:19:51  based on your okay so they stop experiment got anything to do with your imaginary model that you're thinking about
01:20:00  there is no imaginary model and a model wins we saw India well I am treating it as a thought experiment for the purposes of this debate you try to derail it
01:20:12  because you're a petulant child is not my problem right so the surface of the earth in this thought experiment is 25,000 miles in circumference oh right
01:20:26  ignoring the imagination doesn't say that's your problem not mine okay can I can move myself out of this situation and imagine like a circle they
01:20:36  want to do that the fact of the matter is that that particular observation you have there with them about a metre apart would be one one-half of one 111 of a
01:20:49  degree that they would deviate from each other are you you wouldn't see that in your observation you asking me to imagine that a vertical is a radius I am
01:21:01  just running you through a thought experiment yeah I'm making it pretty clear to you here yep and a plum would go all the way to words the center of
01:21:15  the earth so yeah usually imagine a vertical is a radius radius you could use it as a radius or if you went all the way through the earth because it
01:21:26  would be a diameter would that make a horizontal a tangent is that why you were talking about tangents earlier I was talking about it's tangent as
01:21:34  something in relation to as trying to explain what his eyesight was and it's relevant to what I'm asking here if a radius is a vertical okay you know
01:21:46  that's right let's get back to the question I'm trying to imagine your imaginary thing here trying to get me to around imagine in a ball it's very
01:21:57  simple imagine a ball yeah and imagine on this ball verticals coming out from the center ray that's what we're talking about here
01:22:05  extensions of a radius you can say that if you like it's fine that imagine the Hang stood on spiracle geometry but I'm not actually doing spherical geometry if
01:22:17  you like you want very cool geometry doing Euclidean geometry whilst if they want on spherical geometry imagine a vessel is radius horizontal is a
01:22:31  vengeance if it helps you both okay if you're unable to imagine a 3d surface that probably something you should speak to a doctor about but if the earth is
01:22:44  anslee on the brave yes come on you the bull wherever you are on the ball is the top right okay is it we all want the top of the ball
01:22:55  yes your reference rain you are all on the top of the woman does that not make it a bit wibbly-wobbly I don't even notice
01:23:01  everybody room though there is a lot of room on the earth there's 25,000 miles and zones so again the the deviation matches you measure that it's been
01:23:13  measured many times by two by many many people the deviation Oliver do it with sticks he did a very early observation with sticks and got it pretty much
01:23:26  perfect nice I mean that observation has been done many many times I can't hundred years after Euclid wrote the elements to me cool yeah and it happens
01:23:38  if you replace the final posture of Euclid's anyway and so again is that where iris toss to me stood Eratosthenes did an experiment
01:23:49  yeah actually replaces the fifth postulate oh stop the railing the conversation Bev and try and stay focused here okay this is geometry
01:24:00  though like Euclid when he did it they I'm not talking about yes I'm talking about you clear daenerys or sneeze right now you built them up I am
01:24:09  talking about your observation in front of me and what it means for the in relation to an earth with a circumference of 25000 my
01:24:17  this imaginary one you can say it's imaginary but all stuff shows that it isn't imaginary like pictures from space and stuff but anyway oh wow yeah wow you
01:24:30  know if you look ups at a 1972 when Eugene Sherman took a image with a Hasselblad camera of a 70 millimeter film of the entire earth and then
01:24:42  developed that picture in a darkroom okay so this a bit more fantastic it's it's floating now is it you can try and derail the conversation will you like
01:24:55  you know what our models is it is it floated in a vacuum oh very much so yeah how how big two objects have to get before they float in
01:25:03  a vacuum if there's no gravity everything will float in a vacuum yeah if there's no gravity and how would you get gravity going with mass again
01:25:17  you mean where there's no me yes you're trying to derail the conversation yeah that's how would you how would you know there's no gravity if there's no limit
01:25:26  you're trying to derail one of them you're trying to derail the conversation stop it I just sounds like it one of them puzzling questions are quite likely
01:25:34  idea I mean I imagine tying your shoelaces question to you but let's move on so tying these shoelaces is in the question sir Craig Craig keep to do
01:25:44  topics not the individual sorry so in your observation there or it demonstrates is that it's flat on a very local scale and if you were to measure
01:26:00  did you actually measure the exact deviation of the top of the plumb lines to the bottom of those plumb lines what point do you think horizontal starts to
01:26:08  bend Craig I didn't say it bends oh did you measure did you see he said it was local oh it's the horizont local but it so what did you when does Lakeland did
01:26:19  you measure the deviation that the difference in the top of those plumb lines based to the bottom there's plumb lines exactly knowing that the deviation
01:26:29  that you would get Erica the circumference of 25,000 miles is 1/2 of 1 111 53 now they're there assume vertical Antley and the water
01:26:39  level is assumed horizontal and they are both perpendicular to each other again yeah did you measure the difference in the top of the plumb Bob's to the bottom
01:26:52  of the plumb Bob's I know because I don't work on line the horizontal so my yep again you don't actually know if there was any difference in it there's
01:27:05  no point messing about with verticals nice it's nice that I know you don't care about actual data that that's a good thing to know
01:27:21  can we call it data please you can call it data or data up to you yeah it takes re sorry data is a character on Star Trek data in a weapon sciences and in
01:27:37  Scotland people tend to see data and I live in Scotland so I've picked up some things up here just like you say la you know it's a local thing you know how
01:27:46  people say things data data typical platter for trying to derail a conversation I said you're a flatter bird fur why did you say that because
01:28:00  you're a flatterer have you not heard yeah I'm sure I'm sure you've heard haven't you're gonna say that there's hills and valleys yeah West Mountain
01:28:11  Valley yeah mountains about doesn't mean that you aren't a flat earther yeah I think because I don't because that's very much
01:28:18  whether you like the terminal relevant you are we are going to get this back on track because I am going to ask Amy what she liked the clay I'd like to clear
01:28:38  that up I'd like to clear that up please I've just been accused of being something so I would chilly out mom allowed to sit here it
01:28:47  water retard here here here is the here's the question that is going to start with which is going to address the claim that maid is your postulated
01:29:00  position that the aggregate shape of the earth is that of a relatively flat surface regardless of department you would say the earth was in the ground
01:29:21  the land underneath my feet has topography on it therefore by definition cannot be flat that's why I never take that position I've never said that if I
01:29:35  were to say that yeah but you are not the egg we're to defend my position so I never I think you miss under the guard with of topography because we all accept
01:29:52  that mountains hills valleys and those subtle deviations are real they can happen so regardless of that is your stated claim that the mean reference
01:30:05  point is a two dimensional horizontal flat plane with no deviation the reference not the topography the reference right the land of ice just
01:30:20  explained cos apocrypha or the water is level and level means horizontal no it doesn't know the frame of reference you keep talking about sea level means
01:30:38  horizontal no level means conforming to the curvature of the liquid parts of our surface yeah I'm sea level it's just chili paste one that is it's not just
01:30:48  Mary you know redefinition dirt victory since 1824 so every picked of it I mean not cherry picked it completely missed out the bit
01:31:04  earlier that explains that water level is a state of a horizontal condition isn't it that's the objective you're talking about do you know what
01:31:16  difference between a noun and an objective can you tell me that yes wanted like an actual doing word isn't it
01:31:26  so like the water game horizont one in which one is a physical description is it a noun or is it negative come on Craig not as a simple question to the
01:31:41  curvature of the water and then in the same definition it states that water has a horizontal condition doesn't it in in the one where you cherry pick your
01:32:02  definition I know I don't use the dictionary right okay which dictionary but it's Miriam Webster in it yeah the standard since 1820 cherry pick
01:32:12  definition any other dictionaries yeah can you cherry pick another definition because that's the only one you've got in it you've cherry picked it that's the
01:32:26  only one that I need because that's what the dictionary says but at the same dictionary explains the water level to have a horizontal condition yes but yes
01:32:39  it has what is this here oh it's a horizontal motion what the sea level mean it's level means horizontal oh no no no without I didn't ask you what
01:32:53  level means I asked you what sea level means well it's it's just the word see in in front of it is no no sea level has a very specific meaning no level level
01:33:05  has a very specific meaning see things sea level has a Geary's meaning what is sea level used for Oh God tell us Craig has a mean data point yeah
01:33:19  like a horizontal that's employed and I know just a mean data point yeah that you base elevation above things yeah okay again the objective of the word
01:33:32  level is to conform to the curvature of a liquid parts of our surface so we are going to go with what the dictionary says and stick with that and so water
01:33:43  the book is horizontal yeah a water-loving is not a condition a water level it is who for establishing a horizontal plate
01:33:55  yeah and a horizontal plane can be what on the sphere a tangent so a canal that I have it goes for 27 miles well is that a tangent which canal you talking about
01:34:13  the lease for Liverpool canal branch from Macy's up three three locks from the Mersey and then there is for 27 miles um until the next lock so that's
01:34:31  27 miles of level water within that canal and have you measured the you mean curvature of it at all I its how is
01:34:48  listen a cake I asked you a question have you measured the mean curvature no there's no curvature Irina is that Carrie have you most of it to tell you
01:34:58  straight that how would you suggest we do that quake using the method that was stirred when he did the bedroom to measure the curvature of them do you not
01:35:11  know do you not think they already just like just if you can make an observation and see if there's curvature measurements see ya so you're not have
01:35:20  any idea whether it it does actually curve or not that's why you would try and measure it to check I think you tilt level actually curves don't ya well
01:35:30  according to the dictionary the curvature of the liquid parts of our surface okay when we're taking a range of that curvature please
01:35:40  relevant to the question the I think it's very valid the rate of the curvature can you define what you mean like the amount how much does the
01:35:52  curvature occur let's say well if you use if you use R times 1 minus cos a but then you can actually calculate that based on what was H P H would be the
01:36:04  hidden drop and the hidden drop where where do you think it's level water level that's why you use that equation to try and find what the hidden drop it
01:36:17  he didn't drop in a horizontal water on you're asking me what the mean rate of curvature of the earth was I gave you an equation specifically asking about the
01:36:29  water level because I've you know like I have got that test the Virna which I think I've set up in a particular way that proves that the water laughs I'm
01:36:41  sorry horizontal what what test the water level test no that's not that's not a test I think actually got my maps wrong
01:36:52  on your math it yet the on the amount of deviation that you would expect to see I think it's like and 27 models no I'm the deviation in
01:37:09  his observation well yeah so the deviation the rate of courage or the difference in from the origination point to your target the distance between the
01:37:22  two is twenty seven miles correct of the canal yeah in between adults yeah yeah so you're looking at no more than four tenths of the day it's sorry you keep
01:37:41  breaking off Lori's up me he's they all I heard agree is that might be me that possibly first struggle with technology all right might not just be there I keep
01:37:53  keeps breaking up her mind so do you claim that there's never been any measurements of the radius of the earth by surveyors I think I'm all about the
01:38:07  curvature in the in the water level you know that and since the curvature in the water level which is quite easy to figure out but do you know the radius of
01:38:21  the earth is that to be measured by surveyors right level is a it's a straight line on the horizontal line is my story that's not what I asked you but
01:38:31  that's my position you know that's my position don't you and your positions right so you know I'm telling me now okay you're telling me now that somebody
01:38:39  has measured the radius of the earth getting named Mary yes name name person name a personally not yes please oh there's quite a lot actually got
01:38:53  George bitly area square then we've got Alexander Ross Clark then we've got Frederick Wilson vessel then we've got Sir George Everest we've
01:39:03  got the Transcontinental triangulation of the American Ark of the parallel which was published 1990 ocean to ocean survey shows triangulation with
01:39:11  spherical XS and we've got the and my security measurements in the United States published 1909 used the results from several surveys to
01:39:19  determine equatorial and polar radius of the earth um then there's the geodesy primary triangulation of the hundredth Meridian
01:39:27  and the 39th parallel in Colorado Utah and Nevada as a few more any of that good enough for you can you have you got any of the methods that they use yeah
01:39:39  I've got all the the PDFs and stuff here actually can you give us a quick explanation of the best one one you wanna know please I haven't looked into
01:39:51  the specifics of what they do I have just determined based on observation that they are the one that have measured the radius of the earth I can give you
01:40:00  the the links to all the things that they did themselves and the methods that they used share anything else that you know pest I'll prove said I don't have
01:40:09  proofs because that's about maths well don't forget geometry gives you proof yeah when it relates to new reality all right so you have to use reality
01:40:23  geometry like Euclidian geometry in order to gain your proofs from geometry do you you can keep jumping back in circles if you like but it doesn't
01:40:31  change the fact that the radius of the earth has measured by surveyors but here's own Euclidean geometry you keep saying you could in geometry or you like
01:40:42  the radius of the earth has been measured by surveyors would you like to make like they were they you would be into Euclidean you like to think it's so
01:40:52  that you can look it up yourself I've watched the video of the main surveyor doing something the other day that was quite funny but I mean we'll save that
01:41:00  for another time I don't wanna you say yourself you failed basic surveyors like this yeah you say you're a variant you failed
01:41:10  no I've I have a surveying qualification found Weiss what did why did you fail basic surveyor questions then when when was this Craig in the discord I've seen
01:41:22  that the tweets misdemeanor failed they asked you some very basic questions about news from space is that one no when they said is level horizontal and I
01:41:34  said yes titties about Nathan then you've failed straight the way did this one that's because you assume that level curves don't yeah I don't I don't assume
01:41:45  that level curves level literally is conforming to the curvature of the liquid parts of our surface I don't have one thing what is the rate of that
01:41:53  curvature craic and you can calculate it using the formula H equals R times 1 minus cos layers but the hidden drop yes let's wait through it that allows you to
01:42:06  calculate the hidden drop the hip and drop equals okay we said that our yeah you know what the R stands for I presuming it's the radius of a circle no
01:42:18  okay come on giri's keep go on come on hey Ari's go yeah I'm asking you what does no no I'm asking you because you're the one that's give us the formula and
01:42:34  we can do this I'm asking you to explain to everybody right now what is R what do you think it is I've just said is it radius Greg let me get the calculation
01:42:49  up so I can show it to you H equals ah brackets cos minus 1 a yes brackets right I'm presuming the A's an angle it is close - what Abe would be the Kurt
01:43:05  Angle dust in what R is because that's the only other thing and where with the angle come from right let me get the actual calculation up for you so I clean
01:43:17  it you as it's written down yay barely for one second maths proves things but this is like a gym geometry maths is it do you what do you want to
01:43:29  rethink that statement or eclair why would you just or clarify what I just said yeah what is nasty no quick Craig says
01:43:40  moths no no no no I did not ask you about what Craig said I asked you to repeat you just said clearly to make sure that you were understood I was
01:43:54  pointing out the fact that Craig he's the one that just recently said math sees the whole thing that proves things to him so he gets his proofs through
01:44:05  maths I get most of my proofs that I've gained did somebody call me um nasty names for saying truths to my child
01:44:16  but you haven't proved anything you don't understand on calculation that way and what you've done you piece of is brainwashed your ten-year-old
01:44:31  autistic child pottered you've brainwashed your 13 year-old autistic child and that I detestable by telling him that level is a straight
01:44:40  line on a horizontal plane you are telling him the earth is not a globe oh you are telling him the earth is not a globe you have a train warranted when
01:44:49  did I say that to him Craig you are telling him that the earth is flat you can deny any line when to deny you can denial you like you are teaching your
01:44:59  child flatter shite ruining you know life just I've just explained to you the earth is not flat right so don't tell me you are attacked
01:45:12  over you re flat earther oh you have to the earth is flat you can argue you can deny it what you like but that is what you have done you have taught your child
01:45:29  that everyone in the world is lying to them but NASA is lying I haven't taught your child that every life just in space you like
01:45:36  crazy no no because you the tech I'm literally I'm disgusted just being around you you have you not a vial
01:45:45  around me have taught the child your child you have 13 year-old autistic alliance how the my fasting is child abuse
01:45:55  you have psychologically abused your child so you know you Craig do you know what the definition of child abuse is because use like it up here
01:46:08  psychological child abuse is what you have done so is there such a thing as psychological child abuse yes absolutely
01:46:15  there is emotional abuse emotional definition up for you like so what would what would you classism you like me to get the definition of cycle yeah if you
01:46:27  want but I mean do you think it'll say that teaching your child that the water left beliefs horizont that is not all you are doing what I am doing you are
01:46:39  teaching your child that the earth is flat you can deny it all you mean we are doing the salt water experiment you know the egg thing your
01:46:48  mate we're doing that the minute that experiment oh and are you gonna tell him about what's actually happening I don't know you breaking up there and probably
01:46:58  are you going to tell him what's actually happening that we're with the water yeah are you yeah you're gonna tell him what's actually happening to
01:47:09  make that egg move yeah are you going to know him that is changing the buoyant force equation by altering the density and the equation fidelity density of the
01:47:19  yeah yeah you are changing the relative density of my liquid but what does that do what does that do that changes one of the parts of the buoyant force equation
01:47:30  which is Rho the density of the medium that is in and we'll do it the buoyant force equation yeah but you aren't teaching him what's actually going on
01:47:42  you are lying to him by omission no we were doing an experiment Craig yeah but you aren't actually doing an experiment you were lying there just which is
01:47:51  putting salt in some water yeah well you are telling him what that means you weren't anything was not actually done it yet Craig yeah and we are in the
01:47:59  process of to him in case so when you know the stop right listen when you put the salt in the water and that egg goes up what are you gonna tell him happened
01:48:06  with the egg went up and we did the salt yeah did this salty egg baby why why did you move Wow crank Wow seriously you must have sat at the back of the class
01:48:23  having a reason head-butting the team Craig Craig you are abusing your child you are AG science you're not doing science Craig Craig what do you think T
01:48:45  team and blaming you what do you think is happening what I do all right let's walk through this okay a book with the egg and the water Bev all
01:48:56  right let's walk through that okay okay so you put the egg in the water and it sinks to the bottom right but then you add some salt yeah an egg rises up
01:49:05  yeah what what is your explanation as to why that has happened that the salts gone in the water and what was that done D well the cause would be the water go
01:49:19  the assault going in the water and the effect would be the egg rising let me ask you this right what happens when you turn on your like a switch puttan what
01:49:46  happens when you go to your light and you turn on your lights and the the light comes on are you saying that the cause
01:49:55  of the light coming on is youth flicking that light switch a yet what's the cause of that light coming on I if I flip the switch then that would be the cause with
01:50:10  me so when you saying the physical act of flicking that switch is the cause of the light coming on or or or is there more to it does the flicking of the
01:50:21  switch create the circuit that allows electrons to flow the electrons that are generated while the the wave of electrons that are generated by a Paris
01:50:28  Asian possibly solar possibly win possibly fossil fuels is there more to it when you go through that experiment with your child you need to tell him all
01:50:42  of the things that are going on when you add the salt to the water you change the density of the water that changes one of the parts of the buoyant force equation
01:50:50  Rho for the density and that means that the buoyant force is altered and the buoyant force part of the buoyant force equation has the G for gravitational
01:50:58  acceleration in so if you do that experiment the explanation to your child has to include gravity okay okay he's only he's only 13 Craig yeah I'm
01:51:11  pretty sure I should begin learning about gravity is that the sort of stuff you think they should be teaching it skills the reason why things happen the
01:51:19  reason why things happen yes I think they should be in that do you think it's they were like you approach to me giving people give me just one second I need to
01:51:29  let my cats out I do want to I do want to interrupt just for a second I'll let you guys go on for a while back and forth because I didn't want to jump in
01:51:40  but there are people asking that we get back to the shape of the earth stay away from the add homes I'll make sure that right here yeah but they they have been
01:51:51  requesting us to get back to the back to the shape of the earth argument are you good with that Bell I'll shape shape of the earth yes yes
01:52:04  fight are you good with that taking it back to the shape of the earth yeah cool we'll move on from the fact least like looks good if you use his 13 year old is
01:52:11  it well come on let right let's let's let's let's go away from that and let's stick to the topic of the mana I don't mind
01:52:23  moving away from that get himself into trouble he's not in trouble okay we'll game self it's like that around excusing you of anything it's a fact you
01:52:38  psychologically abused your child okay so so guys guys guys guys guys listen I've been really quiet because I'll let y'all have y'all say against each other
01:52:48  but I'm stepping in just inside each other oh yeah I mean we're both going back and forth I'm not I was alone y'all to go back and forth I'm there and now
01:52:57  they have a I mean I didn't say anything or stop you at any point long he stopped me I didn't stop anything I mean oh he didn't stop him I mean what
01:53:09  was I doing the unit felt you needed to stop me I didn't say that you were doing anything wrong I said I'll let you guys go back and forth at each other for
01:53:18  a while and I'd like what ringing singing back to the shape of the earth but but I'm trying to keep it entertaining for everybody I'm trying to
01:53:25  keep from what just happened from happening moving forward he's not how you have your entertainment isn't that I mean do you want me to get involved
01:53:33  because I don't know looping and entertain the crowd joining if you want to follow okay seems to be off in then we all have different definitions of
01:53:44  thought yeah I'm trying to be respectful Bab to you because I don't feel like you've been disrespectful at all right now that's why I'm asking a fight which
01:53:54  both I'm just it did not show favoritism I'm asking both people to take it back to the shape of the earth and let's let's have an enjoyable discussion how
01:54:05  about that yeah okay good we'll start with you back you are right without Kay yeah cool I have some questions about your if P then
01:54:19  Q oh hey old cute baby and I'd love to do ya love to do logic you have a you have a slide the if P then Q right you have a slide yeah okay yeah i'ma get let
01:54:35  me get to that slide and get it up real quick and good enough to knit to the total of that guy's no go ahead go ahead I'll get your slide ready boy yeah you
01:54:47  don't want to do writing I love dumpster fires yeah my new team you don't blame me don't blame me it's not my fault well there is something that I would like to
01:55:06  point to how that when you mentioned the whole teaching gravity to a thirteen-year-old a very large portion of thirteen year olds in the US are in
01:55:19  the seventh grade the second to last grade of primary school and yeah gravity science and math yeah very very much so can can I tell you something Jared I'm
01:55:31  extremely impressed with your math skills just now yeah well why can't I you don't you're not even fun to don't even I'm a bit too chill and
01:55:49  closest thing when you mention the math but it's like you remember my profession I'm gonna I'm just gonna have to send you a dick pic ahead of time and then
01:55:58  follow it with a job so you're laughing already alright I've ever you back yet he's doing the right Annie oh yeah he's
01:56:12  doing a Riley and I support at school we will get to super chats as soon as everything's done tonight we'll try to wrap up the the poured the talking
01:56:23  portion shortly okay Bev so on the screen I have your slide number three if the earth is a spherical object P then B then the surface of liquid water must be
01:56:34  curved q is that the slide you wanted me to have up okay good deal the audience sees that slide right now I'm going to turn it over to you and let you start if
01:56:42  I can you can you give me the other half if that if P then Q what you mean well if not P then knock you what would that be in this case it would be shown
01:56:55  underneath no I don't see that on the screen could you scroll down a bit the surface of liquid water must be curved well if you look just underneath there's
01:57:08  a series of water levels oh no no there's some crayon drawings there's that's not water levels yeah you're saying that so if the earth is a
01:57:19  spherical object P then the surface of liquid water must be curves Q right so on earth we have two tides everywhere every day the two have got two low tides
01:57:33  two high tides so team if you could put my screen up okay yeah so if you look at the the YouTube stream to a drawing that you've been avoiding for quite a while
01:57:51  if the air face is the air for the spirit Webjet P then the surface of the liquid water must be curved Q well if there's two tides two high tides and two
01:58:00  low tides a day that means that the water must curve somewhere right well yeah this waves isn't there's
01:58:10  also some curves everyone oh right so the surface of liquid water is curved then right yeah he's talking more about like the actual water level like within
01:58:24  the canal isn't it okay does it stop applying to the to the ocean well this this tide some waves I mean I mean yeah so the surface of
01:58:44  liquid water is curved so if PDF is a spherical object then the surface of liquid water must be curved q20 careful from that's not well it means nice
01:58:56  deflection so that that would mean the the surface of the liquid water is curved so that's Q then we can assume P the you have just declared that the
01:59:12  earth is in fact we're not talking about a water level line now we're talking about your modus tollens that you've got hang on I have a question here to keep
01:59:40  this on point you keep saying water level are you referring to the tool of a spirit bubble talking about the water level that is
01:59:51  both within the canal and a tool the water level okay now is not a tool it is it's just a big no-no that they fill with water
02:00:01  can you please give me a citation that a canal is a oh come on Craig and I do have to side with Bev on this one Craig because it is a tool Transportation
02:00:14  yeah but is a water level is a canal a water level any device that utilizes the surface of liquid water - what is a to establish a horizontal plane of
02:00:29  reference and so you can do that with a canal I'm gonna Schumann so wouldn't you hang on let's get rid of assumptions yes you are equating a canal to an actual
02:00:44  device that has indications for this reference so well yeah can you or not do that with a canal which is for the transit of well that's what my test
02:00:59  is all about that that's not a test that's a drawing listen it goes to explain because if you look at it imagine the blank want at one end is a
02:01:14  Apley bridge 27 miles away from the black one at the other end now inside of that then two black ones that there are red ones now if you see where them red
02:01:28  levels go to do they go to the centre I'm sorry what levels we are looking at a ground alright well you know I've done the concept so there is an actual video
02:01:42  but I mean that's too hard to get that through it's in it its ability you imagine that them level are actual water we're imagining stuff no you say no
02:01:52  because I've done the concept of an eye I mean you have seen it haven't yet you're not gonna say you've not seen it what am I seeing all I'm seeing right
02:02:04  now is it great and one where I did the concept test of this with the water levels on a fence when I went to the pub with magnets I'm not seeing that no no
02:02:15  okay well we did it we went to the pub I've got three of these water levels we've set them out in the array from the black one and the red one now
02:02:26  can't can you at least see the design of the method that is there imagine get rid of all the other colors don't get it fused by confused by the pretty peaches
02:02:40  just the black one and the red one inside there yeah okay so I've got a question again what I've got a question again what distance did you do it over
02:02:50  it it's the concept test so yeah and what I'm what distance did you do your home it's a water level this well I'm a drummer with meters they come with 10
02:03:05  meters of pipe so so so you between the black ones yeah well it'd be less than that because right so you've been on less than 10 meters yeah and if the
02:03:18  earth is a spherical size we say it is they come and if the earth is a spherical object the site is that we say it is in that little concept test of
02:03:30  yours what kind of angle of curve would you expect to see known if they on Amazon I asked you if the earth is the science EPS here in reality them tools
02:03:48  make up a horizontal line now what you imagine on your mommy again not reality crate yeah over 10 meters what are you expecting to see even in a
02:04:03  concert list horizontal and empathy levels and if the earth was a sphere what would you expect to see I know wouldn't know you have to find somewhere
02:04:16  where the earth sphere I could only tell you in reality what happens with the water levels that's all I can deal with Greg and if the earth is
02:04:27  a sphere of the size that we say it is over the distance that you did your concept test what curve would you expect to see and how would you measure it
02:04:36  right okay take the concept now just answer my question Beth the water level is crazy I understand the concept question Craig
02:04:56  stop a second Bev Nathan you a lot of latitude and even have been asking questions to try to help you to explain yourself
02:05:06  he's answered the question directly don't evade it actually answer it directly okay what is the counter if your position is wrong and how are you
02:05:21  accounting for that in your experiment sorry it's not an experiment it's a test and and in science that's probably an experiment
02:05:38  what's the observed phenomena please your measurements of the water level in its action so I go I have to go hey look that water level looks pretty horizontal
02:05:57  to me pretty horizontal did you measure it well that's what I'm the tests for isn't it yeah and did you measure it so the test is the concept to you and what
02:06:11  is water and this is where we're getting to Craig's actual question Beth if if flat you should see no deviation correct and I'm not done so if flat stable
02:06:30  deviation we all agree on that if per what deviate can do you expect I don't know in order to establish a curved you need a reference you only
02:06:42  need one reference and that would have to be a radius in order to define a curve yeah I mean oh I don't know where that where would you get that from
02:06:52  surveyors Metron suppose not well yes that's one place in a better more simplified answer is you are doing this test to support your postulate
02:07:03  which is counter to the state model and oh and if you are going to test against the state model use the information of the standard MA
02:07:12  okay so but what if well if I say Black Swan duh what why do you say Black Swan flyovers don't understand I'll say red duck
02:07:24  well that is P penguin that's your a geometrical thing isn't it geometry I'm waiting for you to answer my direct question yeah
02:07:40  which gives something about a curve and I would ask you how am I to define that curve that you I am I know I am asking how you would measure to see if there is
02:07:54  a curve that's exactly my test yes works in your test how would you measure to see if there is a curve you would get one water level a length let's say two
02:08:16  miles the black one if you put it in the canal you fill it up with with the tubes and you would lift it just out of the water level a bit right you would then
02:08:27  get two of the red ones and you go from the black one to the center point you would do the same you fill it up and you would lift it just out of the water okay
02:08:41  you and how you measure the to see if there was a curve you just lovely to fill sit all together in both in all four positions where you just nearly
02:08:51  unit test you would just look at it you wouldn't have to India because waters the water levels within the water level tools would establish the horizontal
02:09:03  they which shown you if it was horizontal or now and how would you measure to see if it was horizontal you are you are you
02:09:13  use Internet supported together you just look at its waters oh I'm sorry that's not yet set well you can't just look at the bits of water come out use your
02:09:22  water level to establish a horizontal plane is that way yes I am asked I am asking in your particular test how you would measure to see if there was any
02:09:31  curvature rather than just looking at it what instruments are you using to determine that there is no curvature and that it is completely flat from one
02:09:40  point to the other the water levels Craig yeah and how are you confirming what the water level says by looking at the water level Steve so you don't
02:09:53  understand how thin the water level goes to come what's really yeah you do not see how stupid that is this three of them arranged in a very clever
02:10:03  and a very clever pattern yeah whole story broke how would you measure to see if there was a mean curvature that's why I call that particular draw in the
02:10:15  infinite water level because there's a priori boy position with any of the other ones and they will all remain horizontal now oh that's the assumption
02:10:31  how we do it just by doing that but again I'm gonna ask this very simply what would you use to confirm that your eyes what your eyes are seeing what
02:10:45  measuring device would you use to confirm that the water levels are completely flat from one end to the other
02:10:53  we know ice not not just at their local position but that the level between all of them is exactly flat I would confirm that or would you want to get another
02:11:04  level in there would you not you wouldn't trust a water love would you not I would want to know what it says yeah but I would want to get a
02:11:18  a measurement of all it says you're using some kind of device what a level that not too so you're using the water level to confirm a water level then is
02:11:26  that what you're staying yeah yeah yeah like issues it doesn't think that the water levels horizontal I'm just so yeah I'm asking you to confirm it by telling
02:11:37  me what is the mean curvature across all of the water levels why do you presume for me to tell you okay okay let's have a little you said okay I am going to
02:11:59  give you an analogy but you just said in response to Craig's questions I have a cell phone right here next to me verify that it is in fact a cell phone
02:12:12  well it's a cell phone I demonstrated that it's a cell phone just by continuing to refer to the same device yes sir
02:12:24  I know you waitin for me to pay I do you understand do you do you understand the cop you kept breaking up my I didn't mean what he says okay I have a cell
02:12:39  phone next to my hand on the desk right here if you confirm that it's a cell phone in that I just keep referring to the same
02:12:48  device how's that in fact confirm that it is a cell phone yes sir cuz I know I really don't like you broke up again there at the end okay for a third time
02:13:06  all right hang on hang on I make a claim about a device that you asked me to confirm the device I check the device again have I confirmed it just by
02:13:25  referencing the device have I confronted yes or no your device is a bit different than a water left no I'm no it's not that is if that is what you are doing
02:13:39  Craig is asking how are you verifying the actual water level is doing what it's supposed to and you keep saying well it's a war level yeah I'm
02:13:49  it and here's here's the thing you're drinking industry standard and Beth here's the thing your water level only deals with elevation above sea level
02:14:01  right it's a horizontal plane no any craic well how are you confirming that yeah well it let there we go if it's not horizontal what is it come on it's
02:14:14  curved and and yeah and explain hounds that I would occur and realize what he's saying how it would occur because a sphere and keyboards are that the rate
02:14:29  of curvature yeah I mean we're not talking about that we're just talking about if there is a curve so right just what you always drop away
02:14:37  from you then no because gravity pulls towards the center of Earth not to the sights so what you want to miss the conversation guys guys listen listen we
02:14:50  got about five more minutes before I have to go step away to grab my kid well five more minutes of talking before we have to shut this down so that I can get
02:14:59  to go see him but I want I want you guys to start wrapping this conversation up even if we got to come back another day and finish it off with gravity or I can
02:15:09  go get my kid and y'all can continue on I'll leave it up to you nice again oh I'm ready okay fight do you want to say anything else
02:15:19  before we shut this yeah I'll give you guys only the top at the top of the water will be horizontal but that's my point
02:15:28  I am I am I am asking how you determine if there is any curvature rate between the levels what what device are you using to see if one horizontal reference
02:15:44  plane is the same as the other just saying I'm using the water level to see that isn't an answer what are you using to determine if there is a curve there
02:15:54  or not I'm using the water levels to explain started to explain you can't use the water levels to confirm what the levels are saying Lane the the water
02:16:09  level is horizontal right I don't want to fleece anybody out of any money I could be doing go from Me's and all sorts to get these done but in the end
02:16:20  all it would all it would end up me proving is the water level is horizontal which everybody knows anyway only I mean in horizontal breath frame of whether
02:16:35  you are standing yet but one horizontal is not the same as another horizontal if you're on a husband's don't intersect in Euclidean geometry though so cool story
02:16:44  bro but on a sphere one person's horizontal could be another person's horizontal the because when you took my horizontal on a
02:16:51  spear you're talking about a person's vertical yes oh nice how can you explain how that would happen here's one person if one person is on a 1/4 of the way
02:17:07  around the globe from somebody else that person's vertical will be the other person's horizontal how I would that work is they just told you how that
02:17:17  basically from their position would man yeah how could that be somebody else they they all have their own reference frame for one person it is horizontal if
02:17:25  the other person for them their reference frame says to the other crew constrain is vertical but for a vertical reference frame for them in their
02:17:35  reference frame its horizontal and the other person's horizontal is their vertical yeah he's a it's very slick Ian is that Euclidian geometry or story bro
02:17:44  yeah he separates that what okay all right all right all right we're gonna we're gonna wrap it up right there great dumpster fire guys thank you very
02:17:54  much let's what we're gonna do is we're going to do super chats and then we're gonna turn it over to the to the live chat if anybody would like to have any
02:18:03  questions have you're more than welcome to stick around we always give people the opportunity to stay around the the light the super chats may not be you
02:18:12  know they may be more Pro Craig obviously the audience is more Pro Craig but I don't you know I don't want to force you to stick around if you don't
02:18:19  want to oh no I'll stick around and show you okay you guys please if at any time you need to leave just let me know and I
02:18:26  will give you a time to say a proper goodbye okay and so I'll just say see you later guys okay one second to get get that first off we have a donation I
02:18:39  put my my stream lives link in the chat or in the description that's my toilet paper fund guys toilet paper is getting hard to find costing about three to
02:18:50  seven hundred dollars a roll these days your boy needs toilet paper so so the paper fund link is in the chat but anyway let me get to the actual
02:19:00  super test Oh nuga nuga sent a donation of $1 and his says check the vid I clipped from last night's debate I sent it to you on Twitter and I'm not gonna
02:19:12  read out your your Twitter handle but yeah I'll check it out I'll have to look that up I haven't been on Twitter all day so okay so super chats here we go
02:19:21  starts out with two Aussie dollars Digital demonic Davros asked which way is Z access goes in quadratic graph Bev would you like to take that order is
02:19:34  that not the moon that wouldn't be a zani isn't the vertical yes I wouldn't know in a quadratic graph which axis is the z axis so you say yes you want to
02:19:50  explain what a quadratic graph is yeah go ahead fights inside you this is directed at y'all I'll let y'all to deal with it it's done where you can map out
02:20:03  three axes yes sir that would be the vertical with her okay ilium moon $10 the story I was I was muted there that was responding it's a quadratic graph is
02:20:23  where you can map out three axes so your X Y and Zed yeah they made a vertical isn't it no it wasn't actually x and y are your vertical and horizontal Z is
02:20:37  your depth all right so yeah I always thought the Exton the y-axis got let down and said become the vertical that's why it was
02:20:48  said for the zernich sorry I'll stand corrected if you that's what you let me go with okay let me get back to the superchips
02:21:02  David Oliver for three pounds a sticker thank you very much I appreciate that two dollars from Illya moon this is evidence Bev okay thanks bye I think
02:21:15  they were talking about they were looking for more positive evidence from your from your presentation from geometry is that it's enough what I
02:21:25  think what your any evidence of the tape I think what your evidence was more anti global evidence which is fine I mean that that's the way you wanted to
02:21:34  presented is just some girl somebody called me but names Denis for saying levels of straight line so my proofs are just about level you don't have it on
02:21:44  audience you haven't showed any evidence of mmm no you literally showed no evidence of anything at all and you your response to my evidence was I don't
02:21:57  believe it's there or do it yourself alright number Stajan anything number six for a dollar ninety-nine where are the other two platforms I'm not sure on
02:22:11  what that was in relation to that might have been in relation to the Black Swan the Black Swan yeah David if you know what he's talking about
02:22:21  Bev feel free to chime in if not I'll just go to have I don't know what he's talking about okay slot phones that yeah number six if
02:22:28  you want to tag me in the chat horizon behind Isis no no now the issue that he is talking about and referring to with Black Swan is there are actually
02:22:38  multiple levels to an oil and multiple of them are missing more from the back than there are from the one in front all right
02:22:50  and like I said number six if you want to clarify that question if we didn't answer it already just please clarify it in the chat all right
02:22:57  so then we go to David Oliver for five pounds I love my globe earthy I do too it is my home heart heart heart and I want to keep it real
02:23:07  yes I like that thank you David Oliver appreciate that digital demonic Davros for two Aussie dollars evidence please was he there or is it just hearsay I
02:23:16  guess that's something that you were presenting not sure exactly what it was but something you're presenting is what they're referring to night five oh I'm
02:23:27  sure it was directed to you what was the question sir evidence please was he there or is it just hearsay I believe it was from digital demonic Davros so just
02:23:37  from knowing Davros I'm pretty sure it was directed to you Bev or on that one okay well I was I don't know where I was meant to it been yeah some of these some
02:23:48  of these were probably relevant when you were talking about it and they probably passed up a little bit of time can I can I just read some notes from the person
02:23:57  that actually took the Black Swan observation yeah sure he says most days normal visibility of platform boats will appear they are behind the horizon the
02:24:08  curvature of the earth one must in a while not very often there will be days when conditions are right to see the full image for three months so into the
02:24:15  exact spot as many times as possible to test this almost every day within the three months grace and Gail were hidden behind the ocean horizon that's from the
02:24:23  actual person that did the observations and thanking you to hated her water fair pointed out to me and there's videos I can actually give to show that where
02:24:33  he's saying these things so the person that took the Black Swan observation over the three months that he did it I said it was a year earlier
02:24:40  three months he even said that most of the time almost every day who have been the three months the the platforms were hidden behind the ocean horizon you
02:24:51  understand what the blacks on that so he means that earlier yes the Black Swan the the argument of the Black Swan the flat refers don't understand this but
02:25:01  the fourth is Greg I'm not one of you and you are Claire first Salem you re but and they explain in logic please Gregg and you
02:25:11  are the flat River not going to answer the other question you asked me instead of your dear ailing the blacks one argument is disparate you know so if you
02:25:20  have the claim all swans are white then you just be a black swan that disproves the claim that all swans are white yeah it doesn't mean the no swans are white
02:25:33  it just means that you now have to explain both white swans and black swans and in the case of the Black Swan observation it just means that we have
02:25:43  to explain why on some occasions we can see the horizons further than you would expect and we can because refraction is quantified can I ever quick over that go
02:25:58  ahead and we'll go to the next one I'll let you okay so no the the Black Swan it's a little bit advanced but the whole idea behind the Black Swan is it in
02:26:06  order to make this statement all swans are white true you would have to go and find all of the swap ins and check them that they are all white now the beauty
02:26:19  of the Black Swan type logical argument is it can be negated by seeing one black swan so it it's just a like an opposite of the statement of all swans are white
02:26:33  can be negated by you seeing one black so on now you've seen that one black swan gets rid of the entire statement all swans are white yes absolutely
02:26:49  because you now have to explain white swans and black swan yes so now you understand that that's exactly what I said that picture is the
02:26:59  horizon in a position it cannot be a note see that's a claim you're saying it is in a position it cannot be but it can be in that position because it explained
02:27:13  by refraction your geometry geometry cannot buy with refraction move a Gianna right there let me ask you let me ask you this question do we see
02:27:27  geometry like it Oh deer deer deer creek do we see geometry or do we see lighting geometry the actual term for a line within question so not even a thing is
02:27:52  it that stop I'm asking you a question do we see geometry or do we see light don't see geometry Cray exactly you see light so the geometric horizon is not
02:28:06  something you're going to see if the light is being refracted it's not right it does not disprove that the horizon is there it just means we have to explain
02:28:19  why the floor I used to be like Swan yes understand it clearly what the Black Swan was I was just explaining the Black Swan argument yeah
02:28:29  you didn't get it writing wait yeah the the fact that you only have to see one Black Swan yeah to disprove the statement the loose one white it just D
02:28:39  and what is the implication of the implication is I have to explain both white swans and black swan the implication is that the horizon should
02:28:48  be at a geometrical position yeah and yeah okay but the horizon should be a geometrical position if there was no atmosphere and when when was no
02:29:01  atmosphere day thanks chocolate example is that atmosphere day can you point me to a position on earth weather is well can you tell me what it was like when
02:29:12  there was no Imperial er I'm not saying if there was no Hemisphere I am saying you've made a statement that without atmosphere something would happen
02:29:20  however you make that statement I am because my statement is the because there is atmosphere there you will never see the geometric
02:29:29  because the I'll see the geometric horizon because there's no such thing crank um well it is there you can use the equation 5 7 times the square of
02:29:41  this horizontal and the fact geometric horizon is wiser if you even call it the last one yeah because that's what flowery refers are cooling it yeah so
02:29:53  here's the thing the black misnomer misnomer means intentionally miss named such as the Bang Theory was actually a misnomer from its largest opponent hmm
02:30:08  funny how that works one more thing because the implication of the Black Swan argument is that we have to explain why the horizon appears
02:30:20  further than it is it's perfectly doable because we can explain why the horizon appears where it is yeah that's not what the arguments for I mean I mean you go
02:30:33  understand the black swan clearly ok guys guys let's let's move past that I do need to get through here before before it's time for me to walk out the
02:30:42  door Jeff Roberts just donated $10 to the tepee fund here's the tip I promise oh yeah yesterday thank you Jeff you really didn't have to do that but here's
02:30:52  the tip I promised you an FTA fees debate yesterday team treat yourself to some of that toilet paper with aloe let me tell you something Jeff that toilet
02:31:00  paper the one that comes like infused with aloe it tastes funny I don't think I'll be spending the money on that I'll probably just get the
02:31:08  regular stuff that tastes normal let me get to the super Chad's back ok alfresco veteran oh wait I think I missed a few hold on let me make sure I guess I
02:31:21  missed his alfresco veteran flat earth is a joke now let's watch midget pawn for 2 euros yeah let's do it let's how to hang out alright let's see
02:31:34  a knight Fox a whole night Fox you thought you got me didn't you you thought you got me because you didn't even put
02:31:41  the the the monetary denomination inside of the chat so now I got a guess at it but I remembered that's Chinese yen 500 Chinese yen it doesn't matter if you see
02:31:51  the horizon behind the ship most of the time the moment you see the ship over the horizon once your argument is dead and I think that's directed at you bad
02:32:03  been yeah I'm sorry bet I think that do you do you want to address that or do you want me just move on yeah I'm sorry had some knee fan anyway
02:32:11  he said sir I owe you the attention it doesn't matter if you see the horizon behind the ship most of the time the moment you see the ship over the horizon
02:32:19  once your argument is dead he's thought that geometric horizon I was going over that I'm not sure I think he's saying that once you don't see the boat anymore
02:32:37  at all I think your argument is kind of thrown out the window which makes a good point because then you'd have some kind of
02:32:44  explanation as to why you see the why you see that up a little why you take it when you should well working on that and working in yeah yeah we've the team's
02:32:56  got a good team yeah can I go yeah you guys while you and your team are working on that and you're wasting your time in my opinion but why
02:33:06  you waste your time just understand there is already a geometric solution to your question so you can always accept the geometric solution or you can wear
02:33:14  the light and things disappearing well yeah but I mean I'm just saying that there's already a geometric solution that we have for the observation you're
02:33:23  trying to make but you're still trying to remove it is tough running a logical argument part oh do you think you know how to yes I want to see how you go with
02:33:37  this okay so come on if the earth is not a glued or flat P then the horizon should never be the object yeah can I stop you at the sorry what we did you
02:33:52  say if the earth if the earth is flat but now is in valleys in that's to say you want to go to that semantic again you
02:34:04  really need me now right yeah okay let me let me stick to water level then okay if the surface of the water is flat horizontal yeah but I stood flat in the
02:34:19  horizontal if these if the surface of the water is flat very calm well then then the horizon should never be in front of the object q okay
02:34:32  that is that we have worked so far is the position should never be in front of the object but yeah yeah okay yeah so okay so if the water okay let's let's go
02:34:52  with let's go of your wording right if the surface of the water is horizontal P then the horizon should never be in front of an object I don't understand
02:35:02  what that means can you I'm not surprised you don't understand it's well it's a logical okay I get it let me let me let me read it to you okay so here's
02:35:11  what he's saying here's we sing if the if the earth is a horizontal plane okay that extends out forever that's Pete correct okay then Q would be that an
02:35:21  object going off into the distance should never have the horizon in front of it it should always be seen be hotter I'm sorry yeah it should be in front of
02:35:32  the horizon at all points like the line that is the horizon will always go behind the object that you're looking at going off into the distance
02:35:39  right Steve brought the horizon in the you all understand that the horizon is an apparent position rolled up welcome to the balloon yeah time what
02:36:01  yeah so why do you keep asking me about the geometric right so you don't have it like I average image it's not a problem for me
02:36:10  right mean if you're not if you're fine not having a geometric horizon as well as that's and production we actually exactly where it is you kind of you kind
02:36:22  of avoided the question that was asked though Bev if we see a ship going away okay is it logically sound to say that if the Hirai the is a flat horizontal
02:36:33  plane that extends out forever beyond our eyesight and it's on beyond our eyesight then as the ship goes away the ship would shrink in size due to
02:36:42  perspective and it would also never eclipse the horizon it would either just going to into a vanishing point or really that's all the only option it has
02:36:52  is really to disappear into the vanishing point as it gets further away it would never there would never be a situation where it appears as though the
02:37:00  horizon ends before the boat disappears do you agree with that no I don't I've got a camera and I'm a payload muncher so I I've looked at the horizon I've
02:37:20  seen weird stuff happen there right it's not and just and the water is a bit like you there's a temperature gradient difference between the temperature of
02:37:34  the water and the air and then asked you're looking the way from you you are looking into a visual compression point so there could be masses of air in front
02:37:50  of you in that little bit and that's I don't know like that I could act as a lens to anything that the thing is what you're talking about is the effects of
02:38:00  traction which have been quantified you've been speaking with you mate also I'd like to just point out that argument yes I haven't that's why it's one
02:38:12  responsive there I have been speaking to dot yes leading expert thank you you too the the the dude the permian contact with him I've been going back
02:38:22  and forward with many emails with him so yes I have been talking to an expert in refraction ah what is your point speaking via you actually speaking
02:38:32  player email okay that's okay all right yeah okay so I do want to point out that your argument you just made also was a guy now that now I just remembered it
02:38:43  now it's all gone away it was an alchemy you asked me to explain something yeah oh yeah no I started with a conclusion and you're looking to formulate a
02:38:52  solution to your conclusion instead of working with the database formulating a conclusion based on the data you already said they we're not when you brought up
02:39:02  the refraction you're like I don't know it could be you know magnification yeah I don't know if all life to me I'm just saying yeah I'm just saying just giving
02:39:13  you an idea of but weed stuff happens but again we have models yeah we have models that explain what happens what happens under those certain conditions
02:39:23  and it doesn't not yet model hold on neither my relaxed is 11 but the rules that I'm explaining are not based on globe or flatters they're just models
02:39:33  that explain how refraction works and whatnot from there you can extrapolate from the data whether it is a you know a possibility that it's still flat or
02:39:43  possibility that it's still globe or possibility that one of the two is excluded from being possible yeah all of Bungie Thomas UNIX correct me if I'm
02:39:55  wrong if a book on your own and to Thomas Young the calculations for refraction zone on there like a horizontal flat plate no they're not
02:40:05  okay you're already not no there is one page where he does a plain parrot and he does the calculations based upon that but his models are based on the actual
02:40:17  gradient and curvature of our atmosphere okay well let me let's get beyond that point so I can continue on with the super chat said I don't want to run out
02:40:25  of time here yeah alfresco veteran for two euro or two pounds he sounds like he's from Blackpool CWR freak aha I don't maybe that's a
02:40:36  Blackpool thing I'm not sure what that meant right there but are you from Blackpool no no oh okay um and then alfresco veteran for another two pounds
02:40:46  this bloke slash lady sounds like it has coronavirus are you staying safe from the coronavirus bab um yeah father so now alright yeah flat globe doesn't
02:41:03  matter to me man now i don't want people to get sick so please keep yourself safe out there whatever you do Dave Oliver for 10 pounds ask him if
02:41:11  water doesn't curve then how come a single drop of water is a sphere how a single drop of water forms a sphere and what about bubbles
02:41:22  that's water curving care to answer genius tell him tell him he's a genius so you know guys sir no yeah that was hold on guys hold on he asked me to do
02:41:35  something let me comply with him David Oliver you're a genius great question Gerry NASA NASA for 199 if I'd I don't
02:41:43  know how you guys have the patients actually Bev I'm not gonna I'm gonna give you a credit for not being a shithead I thank you for at
02:41:51  least trying to have a conversation it was a pleasure to have you on Willy Merck 499 ft Fe your UK service number is the DoD ID number on the back of a US
02:42:02  military card yeah we went over that last night Willie I believe your DoD number is going to be your social security number
02:42:10  Joe Steen foul it for 50 Nokia dollars the earth is fat forgot the L but I agree your thighs I'm sure fight the tight shirt is on stage right
02:42:22  now Illya moon for two dollars real planets have curves yes they do David I love those curves David Oliver for two pounds
02:42:33  NASA in Hebrew means to uplift did you say that NASA meant to deceive or did you make any of the Hebrew claims not only yes I don't think he did either but
02:42:42  is a good point III mentioned in the in the chat and he made that super chat I was like one of my favorite things of all time my favorite clips is when
02:42:50  Nathan Thompson was like NASA means to up live or to lie and deceive in Hebrew and then they like went and asked a Hebrew professor and he was like
02:43:01  nope it doesn't mean that at all so what we gonna say fight and it say anything just hilarious when they train yeah stiva for five dollars supporting
02:43:15  intelligence with cash I'm hoping to witness an epiphany before the show ends hey thank you for the cash and go intelligence and I hope you had your
02:43:23  epiphany I don't know how long ago that was several tiffany's happen for me and this one I'm sure five Aussie dollars from Peter miss prime I'm starting to
02:43:32  see a trend here among clerks a terrible understanding of basic maths yes I do I do feel that that is a one of the things that flat-earthers do lack as a as a
02:43:44  decent grasp of of modern math but it's okay I mean everybody's gotta start somewhere math isn't easy multum math come on yeah modern man
02:43:56  there's methods that we use today that we probably didn't use in like the 1500s and whatnot and there's a there's a super check coming up and I'm gonna go
02:44:07  ahead and skip to it I'll get back to where I was but let's see oh there it is right there oh no that wasn't it oh they're back to back questions I'm gonna
02:44:17  give you both questions at one time and I'm gonna let you answer them in whichever whichever order you want number one is God's auditor for $2 his
02:44:28  question is what's a quadratic equation and I'm gonna give you the option of not answering what the what a quadratic equation is but also I'll take just a
02:44:38  the general formula for a quadratic equation and P term is prime says for two Aussie dollars Bev what is calculus used for a the full wasted the money
02:44:50  they're only at least you get in anyway I mean don't you know it's going towards toilet paper it doesn't matter so what was the question what is a
02:45:01  quadratic equation yeah and I'll let you in here with that you cannot stray far enough I mean I I know I can tell you right now but do you
02:45:11  know that and they're paid we'll need to ask well it wasn't anything in equation that can be rearranged in standard formers
02:45:19  where X is an unknown and a B and C represent known numbers so ax squared plus BX plus C equals 0 thank you did you pay for that suit yeah great no no
02:45:34  it's education high school education yeah but hey what is calculus used for either you get chance to go again Craig cool
02:45:49  what is calculus used for is that the question yes that's the question I mean it's the study of change would mean what was it was it used for it
02:46:10  the mathematical study of a continuous chain that's a pretty good way of answering already ok well next question let's go
02:46:22  let me did you know the answer to that Bev or the quadratic equation one what I like I've never needed to understand all that so oh cool in everything I ever
02:46:37  need YouTube I would I would look into it I'm sure at understanding future care about your finances have you ever invest for yourself and
02:46:48  not just trust the person who's telling you this is a good investment I'm having I'm a carer I don't have a chance to do anything like that let that's
02:46:55  understandable but it should you ever been put in that position it's a good thing to continue to learn man I whether the earth is flat or a globe or your
02:47:02  belief I don't that's not has anything to do with learning learning is something that every human being should hired to do can I don't have to believe
02:47:10  yeah yeah you do okay well alright well five dollars from Ozzy or five Ozzy dollars from dough I read that one you hon
02:47:18  Rodrick for 199 be smart stay safe y'all wash them hands wipe that ass that's what my goal for 2020 is this year I'm the wipe that ass
02:47:31  guy so go ahead and wipe your ass wash your hands a really great point was made and I'm gonna write it into a video coming up a really good point was made
02:47:40  if you were to let's say bird a bird took a on your arm in the middle of a park right and you had two options you had a water fountain to wash it all off
02:47:51  or if you had two pieces of paper sitting on the ground what would you do you would go wash it off you would not take one piece of paper wipe it set that
02:48:00  down and then pick up the other piece of paper and wipe again no you go wash it off wash your ass wash your hands wipe if you have the ability to and yeah
02:48:11  toilet paper fund this is the description so I can buy something to wipe my own ass non aloe flavored bella charge for to New Zealand Dollars good
02:48:20  way to die drink every time geometry is said agreed Luke firewall or file Walker two euros I need a brain after listening to try thinking try thinking where can
02:48:32  he pick up a brain at I'm no I wasn't gonna clean you get one mm-hmm all right makes sense electrochemical $2.00 level is perpendicular to the pull of gravity
02:48:48  do you I'll let you answer that one I'm sure you have a response to that that's a pretty thought that's a pretty regular response from globert there's two level
02:48:57  so do you want to do you want to talk about that to me do I want to talk about it yeah Bev the claim is that level is perpendicular to the pole of gravity
02:49:07  with would that be a vertical love yeah plumb bond yes so level to be perpendicular would have to be a straight line perpendicular from a
02:49:22  straight line so therefore level it have to be horizontal wouldn't it since that's perpendicular to a vertical so that's
02:49:31  awesome barely helped is it would you agree that a that a tangent to a circle is horizontal no yeah why would a tangent not be oh did you say why would
02:49:51  a ton Junt not be a horizontal how could you know Bev I guess the question is how can you draw a tangent to a circle that is not horizontal tangent to a circle
02:50:34  hang on interrupt me I'm really at my wit's end at this point so trying to help you so let it happen I believe Bev is referring to is if you
02:50:51  have a drawn circle rather than do the tangent from there anywhere closer to the y-axis you put it right on one of the X intercepts that way your tangent
02:51:05  is going parallel to the y-axis the problem though that tangent is still horizontal to the intersection with the circle you know I think you've got
02:51:19  reason all confused I don't think so tangent is a straight line that intersects a single point on a circle yeah that is it yeah this is to care if
02:51:33  at one point a tangent but but listen it's not okay okay but but hear me out real quick any any line that's not tangent to a circle that also
02:51:44  touches one point on the outside of the circle will also touch a second point on the outside of a circle a tangent as a special case saving system for the code
02:51:54  yeah exactly a tangent is a special case where you have a straight line that that intersects a circle at only one point into it doesn't it just touches the
02:52:08  outside of the circle it doesn't intersect yet when it doesn't have to be a circle it's just a curve as well as like its engine they say a single point
02:52:16  so for you when you draw a line through that point the horizon is the tangent to that circle is horizontal to the no no no horizontal is a very definite
02:52:27  position isn't it no yeah horizontal is a very definite position as is a vertical depends on where you're at on the surface of the sphere yeah I'm in
02:52:46  reality that's where I'm at okay well it still doesn't change the fact that you're wrong about what you're saying the whore is a line that a line
02:53:00  that is tangent to a circle if you draw from the point to the center of that circle if you draw a line out away from the circle that tangent line will
02:53:08  intersect that that other line that you just drew perpendicularly and it will it will cross the the circle at one point and one point only that line is
02:53:20  horizontal that is the definition of horizontal yeah that's where you made the mistake no no no we've not made the mistake yeah okay moving beyond a lack
02:53:31  of definition all right now fresco veteran I believe he was the last woman oh no that was electrochemical al fresco veteran for two euros says
02:53:39  thirteen-year-old kid needs hiding from his knots dad I oh I'm sorry yeah that's nice it is that led by Craig the translator oh no
02:53:52  that was not a Craig super chat Kristin did he do that because of Craig's little round so he did it because you're a child to be Oh Craig okay come on
02:54:03  Kristin frost laser beams for $1 this was when I somebody had said something about the super chat availability not being there maybe it was just for
02:54:13  whatever region your end or whatever but the I guess she tested it at that time and it worked thank you so much I appreciate that and
02:54:20  then God's auditor with $2 super Chat Chat super chat test green shite head yeah when we were talking about black swans and you said what do you calls or
02:54:30  what do you say when I say Black Swan I said red duck and he said green shithead and I was like whoa that that one wins right there yup that one wins David
02:54:40  Oliver fir - let me get to it David all over for two pounds Bev why can't you see Polaris in Australia I'll let you answer that one second I've never been
02:54:53  to Australia I guess the point of the question is why can't anyone who does go to Australia not I don't the ability to see Polaris from house never been to
02:55:04  Australia so I don't know yeah but if the earth was flat shouldn't you be able to see it I don't know I've been to Australia well yeah I mean but I mean
02:55:14  the being in Australia shouldn't geometrically change what a flat earth is I mean I know you said you're not a flat earther but you also said you're a
02:55:23  globe yeah it's safe to assume that I can assume that you're a globe denialist right I mean you don't you deny that the earth is what scientists insisted just
02:55:31  wait just a valus might still okay that's fine that's fine so retard yeah so clever so people in Australia cannot see Polaris which if
02:55:46  the earth was flat not saying that you're a flat earther but if the earth is flat there should be no reason why a person in Australia should not be able
02:55:55  to see the North Star Polaris now there's been arguments a later day smite well it's above the North Pole that's
02:56:03  what the flattery is is that just lights in the sky imminently not really I mean to us down here that if it's what there's a clear attic but there's a not
02:56:12  lights in the sky no okay no there most of them are massive nuclear furnace it yeah big floaty barrels um in a vise flow - yeah I would say
02:56:28  floaty represents means that you have a medium underneath it so I don't think that floaty is a good word to use to describe it but yeah they're suspended
02:56:37  in space they're moving just as everything else is we we see it we what is it the sailors Almanac is that what it is the
02:56:48  sailors Almanac that talks in nautical on there I'm sorry the nautical Almanac which don't limit it documents the actual change in star positions from
02:56:59  year to year I mean I would look into that Bevan and point out where it's wrong you think some of them have big balls of gas in a vacuum I know they're
02:57:10  they're not well that they're ionized gas we call it plasma okay what's your interval in a vacuum though yeah yeah space is considered
02:57:20  about you it's not you base it at the vacuum so what's your point like the fact that this big balls of gas in the vacuum
02:57:28  I think watch the points yeah I mean there's no issue with it the absolutely fine because you know ridiculous well I mean if you've not got an issue with it
02:57:38  that's fine carry on word of suggestion in addition to the one I put in the text chat for you to read do some research on the term argument from incredulity yeah
02:57:56  it was an argument what's that argument from incredulity it's basically the I don't see how it's possible therefore it must not be possible okay that's that
02:58:08  basic rundown of the argument can you can you show us a little oh no sure just look it here here's here's the beautiful thing that you can do that
02:58:28  when remove gravitational influence no no I can either do an ingress gravity notice I didn't say remove Earth's gravity just its influence when you're
02:58:41  injured yeah so Beth you actually can have gas pressure inside a vacuum it's no problem all you need to do is say run an
02:58:51  electrical current through that gas so that it becomes plasma and squeezes together so much this is what happens inside a nuclear reactor where there is
02:58:59  a vacuum of 10 to the negative 11th or right next to a high pressure system you stay inside a nuclear reactor chamber yes so that's a that's a container is it
02:59:12  yes but you just asked to see a vacuum gas pressure inside okay so you you're gonna make a vacuum inside a container and then say within that there's
02:59:23  something will happen in the center of it yes I think I can show you a video of it my technology oh yeah I've seen it okay that's all right so that is she
02:59:34  claimed that that is a gasps pressure within a vacuum it is ionized gas hi hi Prairie Scouts called well what's finite gas called it's called plasma a nice
02:59:48  night yes guys it it's like a fourth state isn't it what's what's the Rossa it's called an ionized gas so it's not a gas bubble one is it not it it's an
02:59:59  ionized gas area of high pressure right next to an area of low pressure which is a barrier between them with it without with no physical barrier in between no
03:00:10  not at all so it's not gas then is it no it's ionized gas called plasma yeah we also known as ionized gas as we said yeah but
03:00:24  it's not a gas is it but it by a noise gas yeah it's cold I call a plasma dummy guys yes guys this Meineke going on so look my son just called me so let me get
03:00:36  through the super chat so we can make sure that if there's any relevant ones Bev what I'm gonna do unless there's anything directed to add at Craig in
03:00:44  particular I'm just going to give you a quick moment to answer anything Craig if you want to go ahead and mute your mic and don't worry about answering anything
03:00:53  until the very end but we're gonna kind of go through these quick if you're like a skip that one we're good with that okay let's go yeah all right
03:01:00  no doubt for two dollars the level of stupid is getting crazy with fleurs I'm just couldn't skip that one for you Kerry Oliver beyond the stupidity
03:01:09  everyone stays safe and educated from Washington State for $33.33 Wow I just now heard about that coronavirus that the that happened at
03:01:20  the elderly home oh it's tragic guys stay safe out there please wash your hands regularly let's get through this coronavirus and once we all have
03:01:30  you know they developed a vaccine and you know and we you know we've built up an immunity to it and whatnot then we can go back to shaking hands and being
03:01:38  super friendly stay safe out there jail Warren for 199 pronounced geometry like Hova Hova and pronounces water say geometry one time for me geometry
03:01:51  John yeah you don't say it too bad yeah are you familiar with Kent Hovind the young earth creationist off bed yeah yeah he says water has water with a hard
03:02:03  T Walker I right now I want to say everything now I'm gonna read every super chat with a hard T today and David Oliver for 20 euros the Black Swan has
03:02:14  nothing to do with proving a flat earth the earth has already been proven to be a globe Flat Earth model is a fantasy space exists moon landings did happen
03:02:28  explain sunrises and sunsets sorry I had to do that what do you want to try to explain sunsets or sunrises just real quick yeah as some gets closer and goes
03:02:41  further away okay so perspective basically it doesn't change an angular size debunked all right good in flat earth five dollars thank you for putting
03:02:52  up with these people like I said Bev one too bad bed went Bevan is about hey we're bringing Victor back back on Sunday he's agreed in the
03:03:00  Chad he'll come in what come wasn't he talking to me oh hey my yeah maybe so how do you feel about Dylan with us all night I don't know why they wanna give
03:03:13  you money though I mean they love me that's why they seen his face yeah you obviously don't watch my stuff try thinking if you see my face you'd know
03:03:24  why people stick around to laugh now I'm making them wait right now they just want to see these beautiful the this beautiful man man Bush I have on my
03:03:32  head AJ raven wolf for six dollars and 66 cents thanks thanks for making GES geology bash his head lol just kidding good job guys
03:03:44  Thank You AJ I appreciate it very much Jake a Jackalope heard master for three dollars and it was a super chat sticker thank you very much Jo Warren 499
03:03:55  listening to Fleur speaking is like watching the movie hackers today I actually like that movie why would you why would you that movie up for me
03:04:04  jo okay let's go huge arse 4/10 Aussie dollars I have a science degree with maths as a major when I hear Bev I just hear words that he's heard at some point
03:04:17  instead of someone who knows anything at all about maths give it up mate yeah that's what we call being on the top left at the Dunning
03:04:24  just don't you go much you guys AJ Rafe became a new member and so did Gia's geology thank you but guys both of you thank you very much for becoming
03:04:36  members if you're in the chat I know been a while since they joined but go ahead and spam them with a bunch of dingers a bunch of meat tubes a bunch of
03:04:44  mankinis and don't forget to use that Nathan Thompson's in jail emoji that emoji is the best one out there God's auditor $5.00 no you know what I
03:04:55  don't ask you a quick question do you agree with Nathan Thompson talking to other people's children about his beliefs I'll let you answer without any
03:05:06  judgment whatsoever okay so let's just speak how you feel I know I'll Jojen hold off on that hold on we all know about what you do
03:05:15  and I me personally do I think what he shouldn't be able to talk to other children is that is that what you guys are say thinking well in a school
03:05:26  environment let's say where they're expected to have a certain they have a certain expectation of what they're supposed to be learning did you see them
03:05:34  would you see the I give earlier I put three quotes up and you sort of past them yeah I just oh I don't think you called
03:05:45  those time for me to show but hey okay look I know we're getting away from the rope by a teacher so I'm just asking um that like about that since you making
03:05:55  the claim about people yes they in things children I don't think but but here but hear me out first I don't think it's right for me to go to your child
03:06:02  and try to teach your child about the the globe earth I you know if you choose to raise your child that way and you want to put them inside of your home and
03:06:11  raise them or send them to a flatter school where you want them to not be exposed to what you guys consider the globe earth exactly my approach hold on
03:06:20  Oh would you would you be okay with me going into that school and violating that trust that you have with the school to teach that that you know that
03:06:29  narrative would you be okay with me going into that situation and changing that on my own against your wishes that's why I brought up the clips about
03:06:38  the the teacher because they were quotes made by a teacher that is actually teaching children within the school yeah yeah oh they're teaching on flat earth
03:06:54  inside of a school where they know which are expected no no so that again later claimed one person's horizontal could be another person's vertical exactly right
03:07:05  that is retarted and it is impossible no it's not frames of reference are a thing one I know what you're saying now yeah the okay so a line let's say that you're
03:07:21  at the equator right the tangent to the line at the equator is also going to be parallel to the vertical to the zenith at the North Pole
03:07:34  so the person at the North Pole would have a horizontal now even on your model that is a tangent the horizontal it's a tangent and by definition the curve at
03:07:50  one knowing it's not a tangent you don't know what a tangent is the Horace dollar here here is the pedantic as you definitely have all just stated earlier
03:08:08  that a tangent is a right this will be better no we didn't not once since we want to be really pedantic bear since you really
03:08:23  want to go down the semantic road with this you have decided to be in a conversation with the wrong person for that DP the pedantic as definition
03:08:33  of a tangent is the slope of a line between two instantaneous points on a curve which are fraction of a change between each other because in order to
03:08:43  get the slope of a line you need two points the colloquial bit is that a tangent is a flat line that in a curve at one point because you closed
03:08:57  instantaneous points as it's about frames of reference mic drop we'll discuss all that look we'll go over that next time we see
03:09:10  because that that's a that leaves a lot of topic and room to expand that I think is not I don't think everybody's on the same page with that so let's bring him
03:09:22  back for that Bev if you ever do want to come back we'll discuss that next time gods auditor for $5.00 Bev doesn't know what quadratic is but still wants to
03:09:30  tell them that they're wrong about trigonometry and calculus I would study a little bit on the quadratic and quadratic formula nuga for 199 why do
03:09:39  you think the world is lying to you Bev just a quick answer Bev either way yo okay no there you are why do you think the world is lying to you quick answer
03:09:55  why do I think the world yeah I aim to me like the scientific consensus is lying to people in general I wouldn't know who a you assuming that when he
03:10:07  says the world he means this scientific consensus oh yeah yeah yeah I'm assuming he means why do you think the scientific answer was this scientific consensus
03:10:19  what is the scientific consensus the earth is a globe globe huh jinx really yes well I hope that came through on stream together Bev did you hear out
03:10:31  is that together yeah yeah okay he's my boyfriend you know he's a boy yeah and a friend of mine he's my boyfriend well we're lovers right of course three
03:10:44  Ron for five dollars Bev if you think the earth is an expanse along the same axis and out of sphere you are you are a flat earther period okay
03:10:55  well we'll go on past that because I want to stay away from those aw I just want to get through this get to them all all of them David Oliver for ten your
03:11:02  ten pounds Bev there's a set of constellations in the northern hemisphere and another set of constellations in the southern
03:11:09  hemisphere like Polaris in the northern and southern cross in the southern hemisphere I guess that's what they're trying to do is explain why people in
03:11:16  the northern hemisphere see different stars than the people in the southern hemisphere on the same night or see unique stars to one
03:11:25  another Robert Williams Robert Williams says idiot plasma is hot gas that shed electrons exactly ionized gas just like FTF he said and let me and let
03:11:40  me take care of that other thing for you real quick all right Whitsett gets it $1.99 ft Fe ooh there it is right there can yes we
03:11:53  have it a property to a private on a private a private a private privation my answer is the same as I told I will answer all your questions when you
03:12:05  debate me like we read to instead of copping out so I will answer all of your question when you actually face me in debate it's all going to bake yeah we
03:12:15  don't have you on wits and I saw you on on MC tunes man I thought you were definitely a presentable character so we should definitely try to set that up to
03:12:24  get you on one day and you're welcome to come on and have the platform P term is prime for two Aussie dollars is becoming over the year 2020 a race this
03:12:34  year yes it is there's been some people Victor Victor pushed his way forward to last night yeah Nathan it pinched it but
03:12:45  me I know right Nathan's out there he's got actual competition this year when we thought it was all gonna go run one flat surfer understands and then and
03:12:54  then surf is making a great point super town of $2 son is going to starve waiting on you yeah we shouldn't have
03:13:01  totaled his car that's on him okay everybody thank you very much for coming out tonight I believe that's all the super tats Bev I'm gonna say thank
03:13:11  you first off to you for coming on and putting up with with ft Fe he was a handful tonight man you did a hell of a job but uh sounds like you made some
03:13:19  coin there as well well to him hey you know it's a little bit I mean it wasn't entertaining I thought it was a very entertaining a very entertaining stream
03:13:28  so thank you very much for taking part in that I do truly appreciate everybody and I mean it when I say it stay safe out there because I
03:13:36  don't want to hear anybody getting sick but that's just shitty so thank you fight the Flat Earth for coming out tonight and participate that's great
03:13:45  dumpster fire we had and then of course thank you to my buddy and my boy 82 productions of 82 productions go check them out veterans talk weekly I believe
03:13:56  we're still doing it every Friday night is that not correct Jared it is except for this week because I will still be here in the wonderful state of
03:14:06  Mississippi until Saturday evening so tweek we're looking at a Saturday edition of eat eat up hey can we come invite the 4-star
03:14:16  general to the scowl oh my god hey just just to confirm he did tell you that he was a four-star general of hey no time don't time Victor out Victor's all right
03:14:27  Oh guys guys let unless Victor's being absolutely hateful please don't time him out because he's been he's been all right and we're bringing him on Sunday I
03:14:36  don't want to see him hidden their time but yes he did tell me he was a four-star general of the Boy Scout army right yeah he also said the scouts have
03:14:45  a military brawn and then he was sworn in by the Queen when he was 15 with with Q clearance which is bro all right as you've got me on full
03:14:58  screen badge he then sent me as evidence of his Q clearance yeah me yeah a few ways about your yappy things Q modus tollens ofey ofey heard about that oh
03:15:16  wait we're joining cause instead then yeah people dare say you're welcome to join him on Sunday he's a character definitely more of the discussion will
03:15:27  be about the second law of thermodynamics yes we're gonna talk second law of thermodynamics cuz he keeps my pictures over and over and over
03:15:35  and it's not gonna be plasma things again we said that won't we deal I'm sure we can talk about it at some point blue
03:15:42  Maggert for $2 this last one I'm shutting it down like stars why is the moon upside down when North versus South it's a good point Bev look into that
03:15:52  give us the answer to that next time around it rotates it rotates like like a count wheel yeah and that's answer guys that rotates like a cartwheel so we'll
03:16:02  bring you back on Beth thank you very much for coming out thank you again everybody let me put myself on oh my god I'm doing
03:16:08  this up I'm trying not to up my endings anymore all right everybody let
